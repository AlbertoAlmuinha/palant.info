	<p>My name is Wladimir Palant and developing software is both my day job and a hobby. I became fascinated by Firefox extension development in 2003, and my <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/adblock-plus/">Adblock Plus extension</a> became so popular that eventually I co-founded <a href="https://eyeo.com/">Eyeo GmbH</a> to continue its development. By now Adblock Plus isn&#8217;t available just for Firefox but for Chrome, Opera, Safari, Android and Internet Explorer as well. My other notable Firefox extensions are <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/google-search-link-fix/">Google/Yandex search link fix</a> as well as developer tools <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/javascript-deobfuscator/">JavaScript Deobfuscator</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/autoinstaller/">Extension Auto-Installer</a>.</p>

	<p>My other area of interest is web application security. There is a number of ways in which web application can be vulnerable to attacks, and most web application developers aren&#8217;t terribly familiar with those&nbsp;&mdash; or they don&#8217;t know a good way to mitigate the attacks. I&#8217;ve been looking into locating vulnerabilities like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting"><span class="caps">XSS</span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery"><span class="caps">CSRF</span></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection"><span class="caps">SQL</span> Injection</a> and others in large websites and reported those to the website owners. I&#8217;ve also published a number of articles with recommendations on writing secure code.</p>

	<p>Older articles in this blog were moved over from the <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/">Adblock Plus blog</a> where they were originally published. With the Adblock Plus project growing and more people posting to that blog splitting out my private posts into a separate blog became necessary. Most articles are in English though I&#8217;ll occasionally write in German or Russian as well.</p>
