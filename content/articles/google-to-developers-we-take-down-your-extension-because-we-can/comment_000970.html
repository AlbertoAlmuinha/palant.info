<p>I don&#8217;t need google or mozilla&#8217;s approval to run a browser extension. From what I&#8217;ve seen of their actions, they disagree. Under the banner of ‘security’ they claim the need for ultimate authority, but year on year, they unknowingly distribute bad extensions. Unknowing bad, still does bad. Security is a useful ruse. Google &amp; Mozilla have made it increasingly harder to install an ‘unapproved’ extension, but what if their rules for ‘approval’  are different than mine, and what if I want my browser to do something, that goes against their ‘business policy’. Is the browser my tool or theirs?</p>
