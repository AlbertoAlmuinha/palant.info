	<p>Thank you for the advice :-)</p>

	<p>I spent the last couple of days searching for relevant articles on the topic. Despite the recent proliferation and rising complextity of web apps and Firefox extensions, there are few good posts about Javascript namespacing and identifier naming in large markup files. Perhaps not more than a dozen. I&#8217;m currently developing a xulrunner product, and while it isn&#8217;t that complicated from software engineering point of view, it didn&#8217;t take more than 2-3 months of programming to notice that naming (as well as the partitioning of code in general) was beginning to turn into a serious problem :-)))</p>

	<p>As for <span class="caps">XML</span> ID prefixing, initially I wanted to use the &#8216;.&#8217; as a separator char, but quickly learned that this complicates the <span class="caps">CSS</span> #ID selectors (everything that is not alphanum, dash or underscore has to be escaped). So now I&#8217;m using the commonly used &#8216;-&#8217; to separate the prefix(es). And the ID names, oh dear, they keep getting longer and longer ~:-0</p>

	<p>Like &#8220;myAccountTabpanel-transactionsTree-creditedAmountCol&#8221; or &#8220;myAccountTabpanel-menuPanel-accountBalanceLabel&#8221; :-)</p>
