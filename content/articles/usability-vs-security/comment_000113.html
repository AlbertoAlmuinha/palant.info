<p>I thought of something after posting the above, and messing with NoScript a bit more&#8230;</p>

	<p>What if the &#8220;Temporarily allow top-level sites by default&#8221; option is enabled, and the whitelist is kept as empty as possible?  Wouldn&#8217;t this allow most sites to work correctly (because JavaScript and local active content would be enabled), but defeat <span class="caps">XSS</span> attacks (because the script on the other site would be blocked)?</p>
