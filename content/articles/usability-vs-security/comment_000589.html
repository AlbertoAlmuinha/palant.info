	<p>&#8220;I love it when someone challenges my long-held beliefs! Mr. Palant, your reasoning is strong, and you make many good points.&#8221; </p>

	<p>&#8220;I’m even able to visit multiple webpages with ready-to-start videos simultaneously (which would normally freeze the browser on my old computer), and only have to click an “S” icon to start what I want to start.&#8221; </p>

	<p>- It is not different if you open page by page, only the page that you are going to be watching.</p>

	<p>Or you can use the addon StopAutoplay.</p>
