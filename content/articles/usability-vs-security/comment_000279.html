	<p>It is painful to see this ignorance perpetrated all over the web. NoScript is an idiotic solution to a problem. Get AdBlock Plus and keep your rules updated through Filterset.G. </p>

	<p>AdBlock Plus blocks everything you wish it to block: scripts, Flash, little trinkets of code. Just specify the rule you wish blocked, it even takes sophisticated regular expressions (regexp).</p>

	<p>Best of all &#8212; people much more dedicated than you or I are blocking new ad sites that keep cropping up every day, and AdBlock.FiltersetG brings us that goodness <span class="caps">EVERY</span> <span class="caps">WEEK</span> without any extra effort on our part. It&#8217;s totally automated.</p>

	<p>NoScript is not only functionality-challenged, it is also a big annoyance because everytime you visit a website you need to whitelist elements of it when it&#8217;s broken, which it is most of the time. NoScript is overkill for almost every modern surfer to the extent that it is stupid. It&#8217;s like browsing with cookie informants&#8212;a new cookie info popping up for <span class="caps">EVERY</span> cookie! If you like this anal style of surfing and throwing &#8220;baby with the bathwater&#8221; then go for it.</p>

	<p>The rest of us will continue to use AdBlock Plus which doesn&#8217;t hurt any good functionality at all, blocks <span class="caps">ALL</span> the ad networks and malicious spyware thanks to my rules, and does so without being a performance hog.</p>
