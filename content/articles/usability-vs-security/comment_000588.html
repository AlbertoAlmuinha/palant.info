	<p>NoScript is quite usable for me. It is very useful when I rarely need javascript. I&#8217;m even able to visit multiple webpages with ready-to-start videos simultaneously (which would normally freeze the browser on my old computer), and only have to click an &#8220;S&#8221; icon to start what I want to start. For the people describe surfing without javascript as annoying, I advise you to re-think the name (no script!) of the extension. </p>

	<p>I just wanted to search an adblock vs. noscript comparison and have seen that abp has declared war against noscript; trying to make people blacklist noscript. I think the problems between Giorgio and Wladimir are their problem and not should not be a subject for propaganda.</p>
