	<p>The main thing I use it for is to prevent accidental clicks of links that lead to insecure and malicious websites. If i click on a link that, in the search engine/site/whatever says &#8220;Economic Tax Policy&#8221;, and get several pictures of naked people and (without NoScript), my AntiVirus screaming at me, then I am rather pissed off and have to run Virus scans and clean up any mess it may have dumped on my computer. </p>
