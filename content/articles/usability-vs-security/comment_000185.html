<p>It&#8217;s funny, my site is validated by W3 and has no scripting what-so-ever in my <span class="caps">HTML</span> code. And yet, noscript blocks my site  for what I can only assume as scripting.</p>

	<p>How can this be?</p>

	<p>Additionally, if you got Steve Gibson&#8217;s grc.com who is very much against java script, noscript flags his site as well !?</p>

	<p>What the hell is noscript up to?</p>
