	<p>I know that ads can be annoying and security is also important, but like Sam said, ads help keep content up on certain sites.</p>

	<p>Here is what I do &#8211; I &#8220;try-out&#8221; a site by disabling ad-block on it, especially those I frequent often. Then, I leave the ads that don&#8217;t bother me, allowing some advertising opportunities to keep the site going. This trial period accomplishes several things for me:</p>

	<p>- I have the chance to click on anything that looks good</p>

	<p>- I look for products/services sites offer to give support</p>

	<p>- I can award the sites that are real good to me</p>

	<p>It may not work for everyone, but I think it offers a fair balance. As far as noscript for security, I think phishing and other filtering through a <span class="caps">DNS</span> server, good hw/sw firewalls, dns server filtering, a good anti-malware app and a couple of additional things can help keep you safe enough without it. Just a reflection of my own simple setup!</p>
