<p>I can&#8217;t help but notice all the disdain for ads even if they are unintrusive. I work with web publishers that rely on a few ad clicks here and there to pay for hosting and what not, just to share articles and information on topics they love. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s pretty rude actually. All publishers aren&#8217;t trying to scam you or get rich with ads; just offset some of the costs of sharing thier work and information. Please think about this and be kind in the future. Blocking all ad networks witll eventually leave nothing worthwhile to look at for free on the net. Everything will be pay per view.</p>
