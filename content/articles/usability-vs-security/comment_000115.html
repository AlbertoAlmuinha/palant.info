<p>Thank you for the response.  I&#8217;ve removed NoScript.</p>

	<p>I find it funny how the author touts NoScript as offering &#8220;usability&#8221; on the noscript.net home page.  It is anything but &#8220;usable&#8221;.  What is his definition of &#8220;usable&#8221;, I wonder?  Lots of people manage to &#8220;use&#8221; it, without breaking down and weeping at the keyboard?  Or that it is merely possible to &#8220;use&#8221; it, even if it makes your browsing life miserable?</p>

	<p>Removing NoScript is, to me, like removing a ball and chain.</p>

	<p>Thank you again.</p>
