	<p>Some very interesting points, ones I hadn&#8217;t considered.</p>

	<p>I consider myself a real power user, but you&#8217;re right, often when a site isn&#8217;t working I reach for the &#8220;temporary whitelist&#8221; option.  I hadn&#8217;t thought of your &#8220;Fake broken site&#8221; scenario.</p>

	<p>That being said though, I&#8217;ve never really used noscript because I thought it was protecting me from Net Nasties.  I use it to help stop the tracker scripts, flashy animation and all other matter of crap that&#8217;s on the web these days.</p>

	<p>For that, noscript is great.</p>

	<p>I think as long as claims of &#8220;making your browsing safer&#8221; etc are toned down, noscript is still very good at making the web a &#8220;cleaner&#8221; place.</p>
