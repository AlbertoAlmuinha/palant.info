	<p>At first I loved NoScript. Now its so restrictive I hate it. I nuked it yesterday. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s become such a bloated <span class="caps">POS</span> that its not practical. Even when you &#8220;allow all this page&#8221;, the NoScript Nazi-Control crap keeps blocking the page. </p>

	<p>I will not fiddle with this garbage any more. NoScript is <span class="caps">JUNK</span>!!!</p>

	<p>Use AdBlock Plus and don&#8217;t waste your time with NoScript bloatware.</p>
