	<p>I love it when someone challenges my long-held beliefs!  Mr. Palant, your reasoning is strong, and you make many good points.</p>

	<p>I have been using NoScript for a long time, and it is a constant annoyance.  It breaks a great many sites&#8212;I wager most of the sites I visit&#8212;and can cause true hassles, if one is (as one example) in the middle of an online purchase, and only then discovers that JavaScript is required to complete the transaction.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve also been recommending NoScript for everyone who looks to me for &#8220;computer help&#8221;.  But really, as Mr. Palant points out, what is the point?  If they visit a site that is broken&#8212;even if it has nothing to do with NoScript&#8212;what are they going to do?  They are going to either temporarily or permanently allow that site via NoScript.  And thus, the entire point is shot to hell.</p>

	<p>This particular idea isn&#8217;t new to me, and I have thought of it many times before.  But having it reinforced and validated here by a real professional is refreshing.</p>

	<p>Thank you.</p>
