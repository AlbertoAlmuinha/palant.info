	<p>If I disable/uninstall noscript, I find that the commercial breaks on the TV shows I watch online <span class="caps">ACTUALLY</span> <span class="caps">PLAY</span> commercials&#8230;. and I don&#8217;t want that.</p>

	<p>If it weren&#8217;t for this I would probably uninstall it.</p>

	<p>Oh and yes, I do have ABP</p>
