	<p>Hello Wladimir,</p>

	<p>Mozilla has answered me that total virus was searched with the link and not the other or avira antivirus found this trojan</p>

	<p>Thank you Wladimir it reassures me, because it was my second addon I installed and now I was afraid of the addon on the official website of mozilla.</p>

	<p>However I&#8217;m wondering because I&#8217;ve never had false positives with this antivirus Avira would it not possible that June 4 is a Trojan was installed outdoors in <span class="caps">VDH</span> by an attacker for 1 small hour time we withdraw because the Avira graph trojan that I put your picture on see that 4 there&#8217;s been a huge spike this type of virus in the world ?</p>

	<p>I have the linked page and I have fulfilled all the charter and described my experience correctly.</p>

	<p>I received a response from mozilla about it in general saying among other things this: Reviews are deleted if found to be They are inaccurate</p>

	<p>This is surely the reason yet it is a real answer I do not understand well. : (</p>

	<p>In any case thank you for your help Wladimir, it reassures me for FireFox addons.
