	<p>@eupator: We (Mozilla) allow add-ons to include ads as long as they follow the rules. Our policies require unexpected changes to be opt-in, and the ghacks articles haven&#8217;t been very good when it comes to the facts surrounding the case. There&#8217;s at least one instance where they claimed an add-on was reporting all visited sites when it clearly doesn&#8217;t.</p>

	<p>At any rate, we encourage users to report any unwanted add-on behavior to us. We do read all reports and take action when necessary.</p>
