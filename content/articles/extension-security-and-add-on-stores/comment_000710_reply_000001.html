<p>Mistakes can always happen, a review process isn&#8217;t guaranteed to catch all the issues - yet it is a lot better than no review process at all. I didn&#8217;t say that there were no incidents with Mozilla Add-ons, merely that there were only few and with limited scope (at least as far as reviewed add-ons are concerned). Mozilla definitely does act upon reports however, I&#8217;ve seen this numerous times.</p>

	<p>As to the actual issues, for IE Lite the relevant bug is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=850360" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=850360</a>. As you can see, Mozilla acted immediately after being notified and the developer promised to make the necessary changes for this change to comply with the policy (which doesn&#8217;t forbid ad injection as long as user consent is given).</p>

	<p>Concerning BlockSite, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903799" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903799</a> is the right place, other extensions mentioned probably have been produced by wips.com as well. In fact, this is an issue I brought up myself in July 2012. There were a bunch of policy violations back then but these should have been resolved when I reported it. I didn&#8217;t verify but from the discussion in the bug it seems that the tracking is opt-in so there is no policy violation here. As long as users are informed about what is happening and are free to choose there doesn&#8217;t seem to be an issue &#8211; sounds like ghacks.net jumped the shark. Not that I am a big fan of wips.com, also their Chrome add-ons are probably still collecting data without asking or notifying users &#8211; in July 2012 they did (Google doesn&#8217;t have any comparable policy in place).</p>
