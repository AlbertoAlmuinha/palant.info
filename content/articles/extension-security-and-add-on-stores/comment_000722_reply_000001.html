<p>Please see Mozilla&#8217;s review guidelines, Mozilla removes everything that isn&#8217;t a real review: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pages/review_guide" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/pages/review_guide</a>. In particular, weird claims about a Trojan in a top add-on fall into this category &#8211; this is most definitely a false positive of your anti-virus software. An additional indicator is that <span class="caps">HTML</span>/Crypted.gen isn&#8217;t the name of a Trojan but rather the name of a heuristic Avira is using to recognize Trojan-like code.</p>
