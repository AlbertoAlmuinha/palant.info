<p>I can see how I could submit <span class="caps">CVE</span>s, but how would that translate into money? I already reported two issues with the non-binary part of this extension, it&#8217;s out of scope of their bug bounty program however. They paid nevertheless, but it&#8217;s too little for the effort I would need to invest into finding vulnerabilities in the executable &#8211; I have too little experience with that.</p>
