<p>Thanks, Jesse, I already read these posts. I probably wasn&#8217;t too clear in my previous response &#8211; I meant that buffer overflows are the ones that almost always can be exploited. Dangling pointers on the other hand are dangerous but I think that in most cases they cannot be exploited. Which isn&#8217;t saying that MoCo shouldn&#8217;t treat them as security issues of course.</p>
