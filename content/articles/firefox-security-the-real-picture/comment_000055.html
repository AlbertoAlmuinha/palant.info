	<p>Hmm&#8230;  But you said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen anything taking more than a week unless it is really very uncritical and hard to fix.&#8221;  And I pointed out Firefox vulnerabilities rated by Mozilla as Critical that took over a year to fix.</p>

	<p>You called the vulnerabilities &#8220;pretty harmless.&#8221;  Maybe you have differing views of what Critical means compared to Mozilla?  They said they are probably remotely exploitable code execution vulnerabilities.</p>

	<p>So, would you say that you <em>have</em> seen critical vulnerabilities that took Firefox more than a week to fix, or that Mozilla improperly called them Critical?</p>

	<p>Thanks,</p>

	<p>Ish</p>
