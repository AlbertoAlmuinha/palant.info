<p>Good afternoon. I have just purchased norton&#8217;s 2007 version of the stand alone internet security &#38; System Works. I haven&#8217;t tried Firefox yet but IE is running much faster now, and i expect that Mozilla will, also. Minimized DL, common sense, and Search and Destroy used often, means that using IE doesn&#8217;t scare me enough to stop using it. I use Firefox because I like the sage feedreader and other add-ons.</p>
