	<p>&#8220;With some luck the hole is patched within hours after it has been reported, so far I haven&#8217;t seen anything taking more than a week unless it is really very uncritical and hard to fix.&#8221; </p>

	<p>On the same page that you link to about Firefox vulnerabilities, you&#8217;ll find the following data.</p>

	<p>Firefox 2.0.0.1, released on December 19, 2006, fixed many critical issues, including this one.</p>

	<p>Security Advisory 2006-68 &#8211; &#8220;...we presume that at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.&#8221;  One bug reported January 4, 2006.  Time to fix: nearly a year.  Another bug reported April 21, 2006.  Time to fix: eight months.</p>

	<p>Firefox 1.5.0.7, released September 14, 2006:</p>

	<p>Security Advisory 2006-64 &#8211; &#8220;Some of these were crashes that showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.&#8221;  Reported September 3, 2005.  Time to fix: over a year.</p>

	<p>Firefox 1.5.0.5, released July 27, 2006 fixed this critical bug, among others:</p>

	<p>Security Advisory 2006-55 &#8211; &#8220;Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption that we presume could be exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.&#8221;  Reported April 1, 2005.  Time to fix: one year and about four months.</p>

	<p>So now you have seen critical bugs in Firefox &#8211; exploitable bugs &#8211; that have taken more than a year to fix after they were reported.</p>
