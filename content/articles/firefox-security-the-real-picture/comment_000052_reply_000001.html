<p>A firewall is essential to protect your computer but it is insufficient when it comes to browser bugs. It can detect patterns of known exploits but when all information about a security hole is disclosed anybody could relatively easily create a different exploit that won&#8217;t be detected by the firewall. So while having a firewall and an antivirus is always a good thing, it doesn&#8217;t save you the hassle of installing a secure browser.</p>
