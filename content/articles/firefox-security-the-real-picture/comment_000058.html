	<p>Thanks for discussing this with me, Wladimir.  </p>

	<p>Unfortunately, when you say, &#8220;each of those crashes for itself is pretty harmless&#8221; in response to bugs that Mozilla describes as, &#8220;crashes <em>with</em> <em>evidence</em> <em>of</em> <em>memory</em> <em>corruption</em>&#8220; I just can&#8217;t agree with you.  Perhaps there is a fundamental difference in our mutual vocabulary.</p>

	<p>Anyway, thanks again for the discussion.</p>
