<p>As I said &#8211; each of those crashes for itself is pretty harmless, nothing unusual. But if you take a larger number of them together there probably will be one or two where an exploit possibility has been overlooked. Of course Mozilla could do a thorough investigation of every crashing bug but that would be a waste of resources, nothing is gained by that. It is safer to give these bugs a &#8220;Severe&#8221; rating even though you can&#8217;t really pinpoint it to a single bug. Once again, there is no vulnerability that received a &#8220;Severe&#8221; rating &#8211; only a possibility that one might be there, one amongst a dozen harmless bugs.</p>

	<p>I was talking about bugs where there is at least some reasonable suspicion that they can be exploited (see for example <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=257431" rel="nofollow" >bug 257431</a> that didn&#8217;t even get on the list of vulnerabilities &#8211; note that the general solution discussed there has been implemented and bugs like this one cannot happen any more).</p>
