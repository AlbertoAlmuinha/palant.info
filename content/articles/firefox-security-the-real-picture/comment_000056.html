	<p>&#8220;So, would you say that you have seen critical vulnerabilities that took Firefox more than a week to fix, or that Mozilla improperly called them Critical?&#8221; </p>

	<p>Perhaps it is because in fact they were not Critical <span class="caps">SECURITY</span> vulnerabilities, but instead were Critical Application Faults that caused application crashes. I can see that the Critical is still there, but the Vulnerability has gone away.</p>
