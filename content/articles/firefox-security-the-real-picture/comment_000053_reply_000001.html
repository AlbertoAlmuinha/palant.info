<p>I never said that Mozilla didn&#8217;t prioritize the bugs. Looking at a few of these crash reports &#8211; they seem pretty harmless. The probability that any of those are exploitable is very low. Given that some of them were pretty non-trivial, it is not surprising that it took long to fix them. <span class="caps">IMO</span>  the reason these crashes got a high severity rating is only their number &#8211; if somebody digs in those crashes long enough, he probably will find one that can be exploited. And that&#8217;s exactly what the security advisories are saying.</p>

	<p>You have to keep in mind that these cases are not uncommon. In a complex program like a browser there are always less used code paths that will crash on unusual input, often also corrupting memory. That&#8217;s not a problem specific to Mozilla, Internet Explorer&#8217;s drag&#38;drop implementation for example is known to be crash-friendly &#8211; and these crashes haven&#8217;t been fixed in years. This doesn&#8217;t have any consequence for the users, they are very unlikely to ever hit these crashes &#8211; but once somebody really puts enough effort into it, he might find a way to exploit these bugs and then they will become a huge problem.</p>
