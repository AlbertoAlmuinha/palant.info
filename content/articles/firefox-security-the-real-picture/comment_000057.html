<p>Hi Chris,</p>

	<p>Thanks for the response.  You wrote, &#8220;Perhaps it is because in fact they were not Critical <span class="caps">SECURITY</span> vulnerabilities&#8230;&#8221; </p>

	<p>But in my original post, I was quoting from the original Firefox security vulnerabilities:</p>

	<p>Security Advisory 2006-68 – &#8220;...we presume that at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Security Advisory 2006-64 – &#8220;...we presume that at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Security Advisory 2006-55 – &#8220;...we presume could be exploited to run arbitrary code with enough effort.&#8221; </p>

	<p>And just so we don&#8217;t lose track of my original point, I pointed out that the last one I quoted took about a year and four months to fix.</p>

	<p>Ish</p>
