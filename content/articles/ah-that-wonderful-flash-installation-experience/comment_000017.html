	<p>First of all: Sorry for my bad English!</p>

	<p>My first thought was: Maybe this &#8220;Flash-Install-procedure&#8221; is necessary for User with Non-Admin-Rights. Standard-User? or in German &#8220;restricted User&#8221;?</p>

	<p>I tested it with WinXP Pro 32Bit as a Standard User with Firefox 3.6.3!<br />
In a Sandbox. Sandboxie.com</p>

	<p>Adobe <span class="caps">DLM</span> extension Install: OK<br />
AdobePlusPlus Downloader downloads the &#8220;Flash Plugin Installer&#8221;: OK<br />
Installation of Flash itself: Fail <br />
Because of no Administrator-Rights!</p>
