	<p>Just don&#8217;t install Flash?  Not essential?  I guess that depends, doesn&#8217;t it?  My banking site uses it.  Many, many sites use it (and provide no <span class="caps">HTML</span> alternative) for parts of their sites, and many sites use it exclusively.  This all drives me nuts&#8212;I despise Flash&#8212;but it means that I have no choice but to install the damned thing.</p>
