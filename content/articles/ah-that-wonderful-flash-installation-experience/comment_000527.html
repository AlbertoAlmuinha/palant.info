<p>Plug-ins in Firefox definitely require something to be done.</p>

	<p>Next time I reinstall some Windows, I should just note what crappy plugins have been installed without my consent after installing nothing more than Windows XP+Firefox+OpenOffice+ Patches (Windows and Java), going to Tools-&gt;Modules-Plugins in Firefox shows something like the list here (taken from my &#8220;clean&#8221; installation <strong>and</strong> after removing every suspicious plugins I could find in the &#8220;plugins&#8221; directory of Firefox &#8211; many are put in system32 or wherever..) :</p>

	<p>Windows Presentation Foundation<br />
Windows Media Player Plug-in Dynamic Link Library<br />

I also really enjoy those plugins (Java mostly) you just <strong>can not</strong> &#8220;deactivate&#8221; (until you find and remove the file in ./plugins or elsewhere..)</p>

	<p>What the&#8230; ? frankly, who uses these ? even Java ? and what the hell are they doing to my system ? (Microsoft <span class="caps">DRM</span> ??? and twice ??)</p>
