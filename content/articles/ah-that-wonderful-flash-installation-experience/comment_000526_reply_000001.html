<p>I don&#8217;t read this discussion that way. They don&#8217;t think it is fine, they agree that Adobe massively disrespects their users with this update page. But that&#8217;s the only available official way to update Flash so there we go. Mozilla cannot do much more than pointing people to this update page, it is up to Adobe to fix this mess.</p>
