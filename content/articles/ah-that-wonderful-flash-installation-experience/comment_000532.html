<p>It&#8217;s about time you mentioned this.  Adobe is doing this crap just because it can, now.</p>

	<p>For me, not only was this frustrating, but after it was all said and done, it didn&#8217;t work.  My flash was not updated to 10.0.45rx.  So youtube was still saying &#8220;update flash! go to adobe.com!&#8221; </p>

	<p>I had to find my own way to the normal installer. Then I complained on a forum that was talking about flash, and it turned out there was already a thread, which should be a sticky, which has all the relevent OS download links lised.</p>
