	<p>No choice? Of course you have choice! You’ve got more choice than any generation before you. Change your bank. Change the sites you use. If Flash is really, truly <em>that</em> bad to you, then it should be no issue to put your money where your mouth is. It’s one thing to bemoan about how rubbish Flash is (we all do); but it’s another thing to simply do without it. It’ll open your eyes to the cutting edge stuff that will obsolete Flash in a short amount of time. We say in England “Put up, or shut up!” :) Complaining is valueless without doing something about it.</p>
