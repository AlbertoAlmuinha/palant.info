	<p>This is really very confusing. I installed flash on a brand new computer with W7 just this tuesday, and while I did notice that Adobe wanted me to use some &#8220;<span class="caps">DLM</span>&#8221; extension (Sun used to do this too, <span class="caps">BTW</span>), I had absolutely no problem dismissing the request and just dowload the installer&#8230; And no, I didn&#8217;t have to navigate through the whole site to find the hidden page, the link to the download was either on the same page or on the next page as the <span class="caps">DLM</span>. I&#8217;ll have to check the site again, just to be sure.</p>

	<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just too trained finding those pesky &#8220;if the download doesn&#8217;t start in 30 seconds, click here&#8221; links on account of using NoScript.</p>
