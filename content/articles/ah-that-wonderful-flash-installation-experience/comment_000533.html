<p>Pissing off your users and/or customers usually isn&#8217;t that smart. Sadly, I&#8217;m pretty sure they will get away with this until someone decides to sue them over their unfair business practices or until the EU/FCC/whoever gets involved and tells them to knock it off. Users have been conditioned to accept this crap as &#8220;normal&#8221; for so long they&#8217;ll just put up with it.</p>
