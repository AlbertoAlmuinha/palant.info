	<p>Until very recently there was a link on the &#8220;thank you&#8221; page that allowed you to download the <a href="http://fpdownload.adobe.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player.exe" rel="nofollow">real installer</a>.</p>

	<p>I would drop Flash in an instant if I could. I already use Sumatra <span class="caps">PDF</span> instead of Reader, but there&#8217;s no real alternative to Flash.</p>

	<p>I feel bad for the 99% of users who will be forced to install yet another useless piece of software (which probably contains lots of bugs and security holes). Maybe Mozilla could do something to block the <span class="caps">DLM</span> and redirect to the real installer.</p>
