	<p>Flash already updates automatically. The updater is NPSWF32_FlashUtil.exe in system32\macromed. It runs every 30 days by default, but this can be changed in the Flash settings manger.</p>

	<p>The update check is not a startup entry or scheduled task, and it&#8217;s not triggered by the Flash plugin, so I would be very interested in knowing exactly <strong>how</strong> it runs.</p>
