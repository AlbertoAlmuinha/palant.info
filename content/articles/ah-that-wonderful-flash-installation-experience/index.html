	<p>Apparently, I am not the only one who noticed that the Flash installation experience has turned <a href="http://blog.zpao.com/post/538816688/how-to-install-flash-on-windows-or-a-cleveland-steamer">from bad to worse</a>. Paul O&#8217;Shannessy uses pretty strong language to describe the procedure but I think it is justified. Until recently you could ignore all the bells and whistles and still download the executable which would then install Flash (and only Flash, regardless of the pre-checked crap that you might have forgotten to uncheck). Now you have to install the Adobe <span class="caps">DLM</span> extension (never mind that plug-in installation doesn&#8217;t usually require a browser restart) and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to avoid it. Still wonder why so many people want to see Flash obsoleted by HTML5?</p>
