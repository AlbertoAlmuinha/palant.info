	<p>2 through 4 are part of the OS and are always there. Part of Windows Media Player.</p>

	<p>All but the last Java updates are there because you didn&#8217;t uninstall before updating.</p>

	<p>This is not entirely your fault however. Especially if you use Java&#8217;s automatic updating<br />
thing, because for some reason the auto update doesn&#8217;t uninstall the old version on<br />
updating. Thus leaving you vulnerable and exposed to potential security issues of old<br />
versions and general conflicts between versions. I&#8217;m unsure if Sun have or ever will<br />
fix this as I turned of auto-update and started always uninstalling some time ago<br />
because of this.</p>
