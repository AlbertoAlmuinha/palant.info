<p>And how is Softpedia not a third-party site? :)</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know who is uploading Flash to Softpedia, most likely it isn&#8217;t Adobe. And Softpedia cannot verify what was uploaded there, they automatically scan it with a bunch of antivirus applications (hopefully) but that&#8217;s it. Which is why I always prefer vendor websites over such download directories.</p>
