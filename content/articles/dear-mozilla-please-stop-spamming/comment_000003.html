This cannot seriously be it, right?</p>

<p>7 months ago I opened a bug report to Mozilla describing a wide class of <strong>undetectable</strong> attacks that can be carried through JavaScript, targetting either a specific person or a small group (identified though the same techniques used to personalize ads) and covered though HTTP Cache Control.</p>
<p>A couple of PoC exploits showed how such attacks can be used to tunnel into any private network behind corporate firewall and proxies (see <a href="https://rain-1.github.io/in-browser-localhostdiscovery" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/shamar/the-meltdown-of-the-web-4p1m" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>
<p>These attacks are currently being exploited in the wide. The Russian Government was caught to use it to build a database of their citizens that use security tools: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487081#c16 (be careful where you click or you might be profiled too).</p>
<p>Yet, according to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487081#c10" rel="nofollow">Mozilla</a> (and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=879381" rel="nofollow">Google</a>)</p>
