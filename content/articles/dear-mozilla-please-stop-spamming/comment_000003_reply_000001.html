<p>Trouble is: we <em>want</em> websites to have dynamic behavior, so dynamic behavior we get. The good news is: the web applications that the Russian script there is fingerprinting, can easily prevent this kind of attack. But there are plenty of other applications which actually want to be accessible to websites while running on localhost. As far as fingerprinting goes, this certainly isn't the worst issue out there.</p>
<p>Also, the IP address scanning script by rain-1 isn't working well. If you want to see really scary stuff, search for DNS rebinding. These attacks have been discussed for more than a decade, yet preventing them without breaking the web as a whole is difficult to impossible.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't think that you are correct when you say "undetectable." These attacks can very well be detected, both by the user and the target. Attribution is also possible, via various HTTP headers. Which is probably why they are so uncommon in the wild.</p>
