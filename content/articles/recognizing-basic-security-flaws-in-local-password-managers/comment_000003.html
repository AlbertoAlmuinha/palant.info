<p>Really interesting article,
So if I understand this correctly, you could implement a website that would be able to exfiltrate local passwords from this password manager if the browser integration is turned on?
Would have been cool to see if it will actually return the full passwords on request, for example by using the browser dev tools to check what (unauthenticated) requests the extension is making, and replaying them.</p>
