	<p>I don&#8217;t think Microsoft&#8217;s Malware Removal Tool is on the same level as Safari.  I can completely understand why they have the <span class="caps">MRT</span> automated.  Just think of all the infected systems and unknowing users out there.  And the tool doesn&#8217;t exactly litter the system or waste your time in any way.</p>
