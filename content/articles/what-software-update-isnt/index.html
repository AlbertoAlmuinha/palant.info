	<p>Having read <a href="http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/03/21/apple-software-update/">John Lilly&#8217;s post on Apple&#8217;s software update</a> I think I&#8217;ll stay away from Apple&#8217;s software in future. Commenters confirm that iTunes offering Safari as a &#8220;software update&#8221; is not an exception, it rather has been a company policy to push unrelated products in software updates&nbsp;&mdash; e.g. QuickTime updates offer you to install iTunes as well. And I agree, this is very, very wrong. I expect software update to keep my computer safe and up-to-date, not sneak some crap onto it I don&#8217;t need. I am already extremely annoyed by Windows Update nagging me about Microsoft&#8217;s malware removal tool each month even if I don&#8217;t have it installed. Now Apple is doing the same thing, and I don&#8217;t think it is funny.</p>
