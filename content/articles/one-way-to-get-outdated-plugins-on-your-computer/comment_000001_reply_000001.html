<p>Newer <span class="caps">JRE</span> versions no longer leave the old version on disk &#8211; but that only works starting with 1.6.0u10. If some application installed an older version then the updater will not be able to remove it. And recently it has been demonstrated that these left-overs are still a security risk even if a newer version has been installed next to them. Ouch&#8230; But at least now the blame is shifted from Sun to vendors who still package these old Java versions (not that Sun is out of the woods, Java update experience is still horrible).</p>
