<p>&#8220;I wonder whether packaging up applications with outdated libraries is common for software you buy on CD (obviously, I donâ€™t do that very often).&#8221; </p>

	<p>In today&#8217;s world, the average user always installs out-of-date software. That is because the average user is installing (on average) a very popular program. Intense competitors chase popular programs, so they all must add new features rapidly. Thus all popular programs are out of date upon install these days.</p>
