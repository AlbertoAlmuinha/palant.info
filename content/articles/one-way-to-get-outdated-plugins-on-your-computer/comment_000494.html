<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.  Plugins are a huge problem in today&#8217;s landscape.  I recently noticed, on my parents computer, they had 4 different versions of the <span class="caps">JRE</span> Plugin installed (oldest being 1.6u4).  This was a direct result of the Java Updater service not being given the functionality to either update the local files or to just uninstall the old files and install the new ones.  Removing the old plugins from Add/Remove Programs cleaned this up</p>

	<p>However, this is unnerving that a company like Sun have a particularly low bar when it comes to garbage collection.</p>
