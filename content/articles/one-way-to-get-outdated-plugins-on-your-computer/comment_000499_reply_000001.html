<p>Checked the logs &#8211; apparently, your comment got rejected by the anti-spam system twice. It won&#8217;t let you post if the comment form is more than one hour old. I didn&#8217;t really expect this to be an issue for somebody, will increase the timeout to six hours. That should be enough to take a shower?</p>
