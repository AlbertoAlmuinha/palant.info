	<p>On Windows, this has been common practice for years, if not decades: Some installation package, disk or CD installs all libraries and apps it depends on in the versions that was just available to the one creating the package, he has tested hist software to work with and that he has licensed to put on the installation media.<br />
Very often this ends up being outdated Adobe/Macromedia and Microsoft apps and libs, or Java. I earlier times, when Windows didn&#8217;t allow to install several different, possibly incompatible versions of the same library on the system (another hole to look at, btw), you could easily end up overwriting a newer library version with an older one and breaking some other application in the process.</p>

	<p>The only decent way I saw that can solve that is when one single entity compiles and packages almost every application and library of software you have installed, be it yourself or an external entity, and that one cares about consistency and being up-to-date in terms of security. For obvious reasons, that only works reasonably with <span class="caps">FOSS</span> and is one of the nicest advantages of Linux distros.</p>
