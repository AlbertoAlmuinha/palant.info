title: One way to get outdated plugins on your computer
---

<p>Only two days ago I wrote how <a href="/2010/01/26/the-new-browser-security-landscape">browser plugins are the biggest security risk today</a>. And yesterday I experienced first-hand how one would get outdated and insecure plugins installed. I installed Lexware Steuer 2009 (for the German readers: yes, that&#8217;s the one you get at Aldi and that always gets good marks in software tests). And then <a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/">Secunia <span class="caps">PSI</span></a> went berserk warning me about various security threats on my computer. Turned out, this application installed without even telling me: Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0 Update 2 (released July 2007, current version is 1.6.0 Update 18), Flash Player ActiveX 9.0.124.0 (released April 2008, current version is 10.0.42.34), <span class="caps">MSXML</span> 4.0 SP2 (released June 2003, current version is 4.0 SP3).</p>

	<p>Uninstalling the first two (luckily unnecessary for the core functionality) and updating the last one (required, the application won&#8217;t work with <span class="caps">MSXML</span> 6.0) solved the problem for me. However, I wonder how many people didn&#8217;t notice the security holes being installed on their computer. Also, somebody who isn&#8217;t aware of ever installing Java won&#8217;t be inclined to update it either. I wonder whether packaging up applications with outdated libraries is common for software you buy on CD (obviously, I don&#8217;t do that very often). While I understand that this software is supposed to be installable/usable without an internet connection (you cannot simply download the latest Java version), is packaging up the most recent versions really too much to ask?</p>
