<p>Wow.  The OS should support basic management of software dependencies and keeping things up  to date.  When I run Windows, Windows wants to update itself, and Internet Explorer, then Java wants to update itself, then Firefox wants to update itself, then when you launch Firefox it wants to update its plugins . . . this isn&#8217;t how we do things in Unix land.</p>

	<p>Admittedly, managing software dependencies, especially when software breaks backward compatibility and requires multiple versions available, is a tricky business, but then Microsoft is charging $200 for a copy of Windows 7, so you really should get something out of that . . .</p>

	<p>PS Your web site&#8217;s comment system is a tad frustrating: load page, take a shower, read, write a comment, hit &#8220;Preview&#8221;, told &#8220;403 timeout&#8221; error, copy comments, reload, paste, handle phone call, time out, copy, reload, paste . . . <span class="caps">BLAH</span>!  Make it better, please.  Thanks!</p>

	<p>Sincerely,<br />
