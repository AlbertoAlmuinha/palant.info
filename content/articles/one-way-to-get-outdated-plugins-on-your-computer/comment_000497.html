	<p>Firefox can tell you if plugins are outdated.<br />
Problem is in some situations you can&#8217; update the plugin for some reasons, like in my case I am using Win2K on a computer and you don&#8217;t have Quicktime or Windows Media Player updates for it. Yes, you can disable/remove the outdated plugins.</p>
