	<p>On this topic &#8230; I recently had the idea that a Firefox extension could provide at least J-Query and J-Query UI in its various versions from a local source. Shouldn&#8217;t this be pretty simple and avoid lots of <span class="caps">CDN</span>-based tracking? (Yes, the extension might be few megabytes large in the end, because there are so many possible J-Query versions&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t care. Actually, I would love to get around Google Fonts this way too, even though that would result in a one-time several hundred megabyte download.)</p>
