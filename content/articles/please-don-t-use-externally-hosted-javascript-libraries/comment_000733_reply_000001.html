<p>I was mostly replying to your claims that <span class="caps">CDN</span>s in their current state help with caching. Of course the browsers could pull some tricks to improve the caching here: by merging all the various download <span class="caps">URL</span>s for the libraries into one, by increasing the expiration intervals, by downloading the libraries from a trusted source etc. Also, which libraries? It&#8217;s most likely more about various jQuery plugins than about jQuery itself. That&#8217;s a non-trivial effort on the side of the browser vendors, did anybody ever write a proper proposal on that?</p>
