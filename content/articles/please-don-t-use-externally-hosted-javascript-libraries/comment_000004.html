	<p>Web developers are frequently hammered with some tip on how to do the next best trendy thing. Central hosting was yet another one of these tips that I took with a grain of salt for many months. Eventually I realized its about caching, not just distributed hosting enabling faster download. I could be wrong but if a browser sees jslibrary.js being requested on egdomain.com, and some other site a user has already visited already retrieved that file from the same domain, the browser will use the cached version.</p>

	<p>So any library file that is near ubiquitous, like jQuery, will often be loaded from super fast local cache if two sites both load exactly the same domain and filename.</p>

	<p>The issue here is really that browser developers are ignorant of the caching ball aches that developers face. Ubiquitous libraries should be periodically downloaded by the browser, in the background, like any other update, to a central cache all developers can refer to. It would save a significant amount of traffic on the net and speed it up as well, especially on mobiles.</p>

	<p>As a developer, why shouldn&#8217;t I be able to confidently load ubiquitous libraries from browser cache every time?</p>

	<p>Whilst browser developers continue to innovate or iterate their JS engines and endless meetings are held on standardization, &#8230; in the real world, the only standards or engines that matter in the present tense are those &#8216;set&#8217; by compatibility libraries. Until we live in a magical world where no compatibility libraries are ever required, browser developers should take the responsibility for &#8216;hosting&#8217; common libraries away from the <span class="caps">CDN</span>s and networks.</p>
