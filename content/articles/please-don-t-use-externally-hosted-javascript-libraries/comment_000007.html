	<p>I&#8217;ve felt this way since I first saw this idea 7 years ago. Back then libraries were much smaller, and the possibility of getting client calls at 2:00 AM because the <span class="caps">CDN</span> was doing scheduled maintenance kept me from drinking the caching kool-aid. Not to mention this is only initial page-load, after that the library is cached from your domain. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning here using mobile cache as a reason to link out to libraries is fear mongering. Most mobile browsers open with a cleared cache (when you open the browser it re-loads the page you had opened last and it is not instantaneous). There&#8217;s no substitute for mobile-first architecture. If the framework is too heavy to load on mobile, look for alternatives, don&#8217;t rely on cache.</p>
