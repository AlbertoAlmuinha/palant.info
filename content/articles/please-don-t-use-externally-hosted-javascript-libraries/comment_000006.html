	<p>I don&#8217;t know that the versioning would be a problem if the browsers ripped down ubiquitous libraries like any other update. If anything, the versioning problem is more evidence of why browsers should store ubiquitous libraries on a user&#8217;s machine for developers to access. I doubt that many users are going to complain about browsers using an extra 10 MB or so of storage space on their drives when the Firefox cache is already huge (half a gig?).</p>

	<p>If Mozilla is serious about the open web on mobiles, surely this move is imperative? Why should developers trying to support the open web on mobiles have slower access to all the JavaScript-built functionality than developers of native apps have access to functionality immediately available in the phone&#8217;s software stack? </p>

	<p>I can just imagine developer A, who is  trying to convince some manager to support open web apps on mobile phones instead of native apps, trying to explain that the open web app will run slower because it has to wait for a bunch of libraries to download before it active the UI. Meanwhile developer B says &#8220;well, a native app initializes faster and we can get marketing cred through the app stores&#8221;. Which developer do you think the manager is going to go with? It&#8217;s already hard enough to be an open web advocate. Sure it&#8217;s got easier with HTML5 but then alone came &#8216;smart&#8217; pones and &#8216;apps&#8221; and it got hard again. Don&#8217;t make it any harder for open web advocates to promote the open web! Make compatibility libraries local/native in the browser!</p>
