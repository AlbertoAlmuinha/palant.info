<p>The privacy concern is real, but the real-world scope of it should be mitigated by the <span class="caps">CDN</span> serving a 1-year expiry. In theory, the <span class="caps">CDN</span> will miss some large percentage (&gt; 99%, I&#8217;d think) of opportunities to track the user due to it being in the cache. <span class="caps">YMMV</span> based on cache sizes, version mismatches, etc.</p>
