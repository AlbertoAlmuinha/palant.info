	<p>I have to disagree with just about all your points :(</p>

	<p><span class="caps">CDN</span>&#8217;s have their place and for the right content (common libraries used a lot by other sites) you should use them. Caching as mentioned is the biggest gain and reason alone for using it. Few sites are using the latest versions of various libraries, but they are using the one that works for their site and their code and you know what&#8230;that is exactly the right one to use for their needs. In short <span class="caps">CDN</span>&#8217;s potentially save a 100K download (and the <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection and <span class="caps">DNS</span> lookup time as they are common domain names, google et al).</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve a post saying just about the opposite of this one from a few years back https://offroadcode.com/blog/1501/content-delivery-networks-are-your-friend-and-here-is-why/</p>

	<p>Regarding security which is a new one, I mainly focus on using common libraries (lets just say jQuery and be done with it) hosted on google&#8217;s <span class="caps">CDN</span>, built for the job. If something happens there then most of the web for most people is in trouble, I believe that is what memyselfandi above was on about. If you use Google at all then you are already giving them plenty more info then they can get from a <span class="caps">CDN</span> download.</p>
