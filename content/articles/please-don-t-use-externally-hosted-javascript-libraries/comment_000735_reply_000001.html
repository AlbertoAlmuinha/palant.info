<p>True, this is something I didn&#8217;t consider. I verified that cdnjs sets a 1 year expiration interval, code.jquery.com even 10 years. So while in theory a <span class="caps">CDN</span> might decide to show a lower expiration interval to a particular user and track his way through the web, it normally won&#8217;t do so, at least not on a large scale.</p>
