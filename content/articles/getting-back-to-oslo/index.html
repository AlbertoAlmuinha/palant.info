	<p>I already left Darmstadt and I am on my way back to Oslo now. The unpleasant surprise is that Germanwings no longer flies to Oslo. I have no idea why they stopped serving this direction in the middle of the season&nbsp;&mdash; I couldn&#8217;t find it mentioned anywhere, there are just no more flights between Cologne and Oslo (the webpages of both airports confirm this so this isn&#8217;t a glitch in Germanwings&#8217; database). That means that I will fly from DÃ¼sseldorf with Norwegian which is slightly less convenient. But at least I will spend a few more days in Cologne.</p>

	<p>I have to be finished with my PhD in two months, so I guess I will be very busy now. Don&#8217;t expect to see much Adblock Plus progress during this time and I probably won&#8217;t look at the forum all too often. As usually, anything urgent is better sent with a mail directly to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/346">me</a>. I cannot promise a fast reply but I will look at it.</p>
