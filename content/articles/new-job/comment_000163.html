	<p>Congratulations on the new job,hope it goes well for you. Huge fan of Adblock plus.<br />
Whilst you&#8217;re at TomTom ask them for some linux support for TomTom sat Navs,at the moment I have to use a virtualised Xp to update it. TomToms are Linux based after all,one of my reasons for choosing the brand.<br />
I can&#8217;t browse the web for 5 minutes without Adblockplus!!</p>
