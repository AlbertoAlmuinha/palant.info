	<p>I have been very silent recently, but I think it is time to give an update on what I am doing. Today is officially the first day on my new job&nbsp;&mdash; I am joining the developer team behind <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/plus/service.php?ID=17">TomTom HOME</a>. Nice at least one of my hobbies (Mozilla) has made it to a job. TomTom allowed me to stay in Cologne but I expect going to Amsterdam rather frequently.</p>
