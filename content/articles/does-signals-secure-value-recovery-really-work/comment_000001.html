<p>Perhaps I missed something, but is there a way to opt out of this new feature, preventing the upload entirely? I don't see an option to disable online backups / Secure Value Recovery within Signal's Android UI, only one to disable 'external storage' (local) backups. Are online backups disabled by default until a PIN/password is set (and that's just not clearly stated) or are they enabled by default and unprotected until a (potentially compromisable) PIN/password is set?</p>
<p>I already used local backups and copied them off to another storage medium regularly; storing any of my data remotely is not something I'm interested in.</p>
