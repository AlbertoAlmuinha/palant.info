<p>Story a bit old but never less important today. People rely on syncing for obvious reasons, it saves time. But I think we can all agree that time savers often take steps that can expose weakness that can be exploited. Same goes for auto fill features that can fill in forms with your name, address, even pay information. This happens on local computers as well as on web sites which may or may not protect your information really well. I think storing or syncing any personal information to an external source can add exposure you may not want.</p>
