<p>Wladimir thanks for the analysis and the follow up.  Questions for you:</p>

	<p>1)  Have you noticed a pwdmgr that&#8217;s better because I&#8217;d like to consider switching to it.</p>

	<p>2)  If you have not noticed one better I&#8217;m willing to propose a secure design and built it.  Would you be open to commenting on a proposal?</p>

	<p>There have too many problems with LP over the years, I tried a couple times to offer suggestions to help them but no response.  I&#8217;m not hot to make my own product and would gladly pay someone else for excellence in usability and security.   But if it&#8217;s not been done someone has to do it.</p>

	<p>Best regards -</p>
