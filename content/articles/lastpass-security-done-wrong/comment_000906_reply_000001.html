<p>I&#8217;m not a passwords manager expert. Personally, I like the concept of generating per-site passwords but most tools doing that have security and usability issues &#8211; which is why I&#8217;ve created my own with Easy Passwords. But that&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s thing.</p>

	<p>If you want something more comparable to LastPass then 1Password is the obvious alternative, they have a much better security track record. Tavis Ormandy supposedly has something in the pipeline for them as well, we&#8217;ll see what it turns out to be. Other than that people often recommend KeePass and KeePassX which are free and open source &#8211; no browser integration here which is bad for usability but good for security.</p>
