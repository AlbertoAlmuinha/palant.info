	<p>You can try Sticky Password. Very similar to lastpass and hopefully doesn&#8217;t have the security problems similar to the ones mentioned in the article. </p>

	<p>It has also a one year premium giveaway for a few more days if you download it through sharewareonsale. I wouldn&#8217;t miss it if I were looking for an alternative to lastpass.</p>
