	<p>I know this post is old, but I found it just now.</p>

	<p>A lot of companies are using <span class="caps">SSL</span>-intercepting filtering proxies, for one reason or another. Some are just overzealous, others have to do it because of contract requirements with customers or partners or, much more important, protection of minors, which is mandatory eg. in Germany if a company has apprentices who are allowed to access the internet. I&#8217;m an IT pro (infrastructure consulting) and quite a few of my customers are using <span class="caps">SSL</span> interception. Usually, larger companies are good at keeping their proxies up-to-date. Smaller ones, however, are more lenient and use ages old hard- and software, unknowingly creating a greater security hazard than they had without the proxy. And they refuse to update, mostly due to cost &#8211; and because &#8220;why, it works&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Like it or not, <span class="caps">SSL</span> intercepting proxies are not going away.</p>

	<p>The sad part is that, for example, Firefox devs seem to ignore this fact (or take an arrogant approach aka &#8220;get rid of that proxy&#8221;). Firefox accepts only certificates from built-in trusted CAs for updating itself or its addons, no user-added trusts (that&#8217;s hardcoded, afaik). So Firefox users behind forced <span class="caps">SSL</span>-intercepting proxies are mostly using outdated versions of the browser and any addons that they might have managed to install one way or another. One more nail in FFs coffin when it comes to corporate use. Sadly.</p>

	<p>Getting back on topic, I do like the fact that at least <span class="caps">ABP</span> can update its filter lists behind an <span class="caps">SSL</span> intercepting proxy. Too bad that <span class="caps">ABP</span> itself can&#8217;t be updated.</p>
