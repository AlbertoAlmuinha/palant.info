	<p>Note a non negligible population is running Firefox versions as old as 3.6. Considering some sites like to screw up users of old browsers by UA checking while their site works just fine, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised they&#8217;d change their UA. Also, there are companies where (old) Firefox versions are installed with specific settings. Those settings may e.g. reenable SSLv2 for some reason (one of which could very well be that it was necessary when Mozilla turned it off by default, and was left this way since then).<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if that and other similar scenarios account for more of what you observed than MitM attacks.</p>
