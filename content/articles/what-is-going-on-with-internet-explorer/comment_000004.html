	<p>Better yet, why do they have to up the major version #? Why can&#8217;t they release IE 7.1 or IE7 SP1 and work on that stuff and then offer it as an update. IE6 standards support suck, IE7 standards support suck, and no doubt, IE8 standards support will suck. I am sure Firefox 1.0 supports standards many times better than IE8 will.</p>

Perhaps all sites should do that in order to force MS to do something more than give IE a new theme and do very little work on it and up the major version #, or promote browsers that support standards that allow the website to look like the author intended.</p>
