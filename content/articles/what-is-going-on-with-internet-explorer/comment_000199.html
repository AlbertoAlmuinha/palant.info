	<p>Wow. Good post and many great points. I have nothing more to add, except my frustration with the lousy IE browser. It&#8217;s very unlikely that I&#8217;ll ever go back to it from Firefox. I even installed Firefox on my mother&#8217;s computer and disabled IE. Unlike her previous computer, she&#8217;s had no browser issues at all. That speaks volumes, I think.</p>
