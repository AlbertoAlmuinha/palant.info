	<p>The problem is, disabling <span class="caps">MSIE</span> doesn&#8217;t quite stop it from being able to do damage (.<span class="caps">DLL</span> files, etc.); litepc.com is capable of removing the <span class="caps">MSIE</span> components from the system, but again the problem there is that a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of software depends on things like the <span class="caps">HTML</span> rendering engine to function&#8230; For example McAfee, etc.</p>

	<p>I wish things were different, so that we may be rid of <span class="caps">MSIE</span> forever. Unfortunately, things aren&#8217;t so &#8211; but keeping <span class="caps">MSIE</span> in offline mode, with Internet Options up highest does help and often.</p>

	<p>ps. Forget about vi$ta..:)</p>
