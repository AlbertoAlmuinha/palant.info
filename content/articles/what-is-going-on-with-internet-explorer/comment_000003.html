	<p>In my humble opinion, I believe they have moved into &#8220;open source&#8217; products etc; to capitalize on better products that are otherwise free.</p>

	<p>They know nothing of stooping far below the level of techno- etiquitte . Now I can run very little from Vista, except install Ubuntu from the desktop, but in Kubuntu 7.10<br />
I have access to all my M$N windozzze files.<br />
Go figure. <br />
M$N has not gotten the hang of how it works, but are marketing it as such just the same. The Vista anytime upgrade is dumber than Bush, and that&#8217;s bad. Forget tech support, unless they passed around the issues I encountered and resolved on my own via search and seize<br />
online research.<br />
If they knew certain components had to be disabled, or the vendor where I purchased my upgrade knew- it would have saved me days of going no where.<br />
I bought stock in Apple.</p>

	<p>Great product by the way; Adblock is the first thing I add on each time I have to reinstall&#8230;.</p>

	<p>I hope this is my <span class="caps">LAST</span> time!</p>

	<p>Vielen danke!<br />
