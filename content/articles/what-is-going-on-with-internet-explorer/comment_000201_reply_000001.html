<p>I am not sure gnomeslackbuild.org really intended to do that. IE doesn&#8217;t support modifiers on the @import statement in <span class="caps">CSS</span>, this is why it fails to load the stylesheet of the page. But if you remove the modifier the site looks exactly the same in IE as in all other browsers. I can imagine that gnomeslackbuild.org doesn&#8217;t get many visitors with IE, something like this can go unnoticed then. But I must admit, I played with the idea of giving IE a simplified version of my site (not adblockplus.org) a few years ago &#8211; just because it was so painful to support it.</p>
