<p>I guess that $($.find(tagname + &#8220; &gt; .temporary&#8221;)) or $(document).find(tagname + &#8220; &gt; .temporary&#8221;) would be better in terms of performance. Still, one would have to use this pattern consistently throughout the code, even with <span class="caps">DOM</span> manipulation functions.</p>
