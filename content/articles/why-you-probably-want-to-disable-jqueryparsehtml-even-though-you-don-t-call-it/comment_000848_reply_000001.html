<p>Thank you, that&#8217;s indeed useful. So throwing in jQuery.htmlPrettifier() will make sure that any code parsing <span class="caps">HTML</span> will fail in an obvious way. It seems that this hook also allows sanitizing the input but that&#8217;s pretty hard to get right (maybe if a reference implementation existed).</p>
