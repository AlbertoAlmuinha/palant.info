	<p>I read through EmailXT quite a bit. I completely agree that a very clear specification and protocol description, key publishing and all details are needed to be laid out in open for good adoption.</p>

	<p>However it is an excellent method to solve several email related issues and I think it is simply awesome in its scope, ideas and realization / implementation (should be open source software and open protocol with complete specification).</p>

	<p>One very major issue is ok, I will use only InfinityXT and be a vehement propagant and will convince as many people as possible towards it. <span class="caps">BUT</span> the biggest problem is it is not open source ! How can you place all your trust (one of the problems trying to be solved is privacy / encryption etc.) into this software that is not open source ! </p>

	<p>I think integrating this into Thunderbird is a superb idea ! </p>

	<p>As for other applications like photo or calendar sharing etc. I think that&#8217;s simply awesome too ! I think given a clear specification and given an open source software, all people <span class="caps">SHOULD</span> use only EmailXT and its extensions. Its simply awesome ! Only less savvy or dump people would do otherwise.</p>

	<p>I would also suggest incorporating voip with encryption into the extensions associated with InfinityXP. Of course the actual lower level details of service, actual encryption etc is completely different. But the basic ideas of trust / relationship, encryption, avoiding spam etc. is very applicable here. One day <span class="caps">VOIP</span> might be too widespread and sickening spammers might start spamming <span class="caps">VOIP</span> calls. EmailXT already has the solution. I suggest that EmailXT patent some of these ideas and open (incurs cost) or simply release under  some open licensing / patenting ways.</p>

	<p>Hats off to you and your team Jorge Santos ! Please post your public key if possible.</p>
