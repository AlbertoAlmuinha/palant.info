	<p>I have wondered about this too. I thought it might be something in Vista, but I haven&#8217;t seen/or heard anything about it being in Vista. And I use Gmail and still get plenty of spam delivered to my inbox as well. Although I see a ton more that is move to the spam folder. Guess this is going to be a forever on going battle much like online ads.</p>
