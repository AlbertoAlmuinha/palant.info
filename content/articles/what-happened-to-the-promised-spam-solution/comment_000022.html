	<p>The big service providers &#8212; and now increasingly corporate receivers &#8212; are switching over to a more aggressive use of reputation services to cut down on malicious traffic. You rightly point out that zombies are making it harder to spot bad IPs, because zombies pop up on new, never-seen-before IPs all the time. What many major receivers are now doing is to throttle or otherwise limit the traffic from as-yet-unknown IPs, while providing a good quality of service only to those IPs from which they have received lots of good mail in the past.</p>

	<p>The problem with spam now is not so much that the spammer&#8217;s have switched tactics to out-wit the filters &#8212; that will be dealt with in time. Rather, the problem is that they are now sending out so much traffic that it&#8217;s not possible for a site of any significant size to receive and then filter everything. The traditional design of most MTAs is not up to the challenge of receiving all this traffic.</p>

	<p>Disclaimer: I founded a company specifically to deal with this problem. Readers may be interested to check out our traffic shaping software, which can reduce bad traffic by 90%, saving the <span class="caps">MTA</span> from total destruction.</p>
