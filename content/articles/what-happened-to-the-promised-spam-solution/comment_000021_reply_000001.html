<p>Thank you for pointing me to this project, I wasn’t aware of it. There is no real specification so what I say here is only my impression from looking at the documentation, all these points might be wrong. It seems to have been largely influenced by challenge-response schemes. The problem is that exchanging messages might take a while in this case, email software often doesn’t run all the time. Second problem is that it seems to assume that only one client is running, however the user might have email clients at home and at work for example. What happens if these two clients send different challenges to the requester? Finally, what is this challenge? How do you generate a riddle that only someone who has “permission” to “relate” to the user can solve but not a spam bot for example?</p>

	<p>I also fail to see the reason behind a “relationship key”. Why isn’t it enough that your contact knows your public key and will accept messages encrypted with your key? And something I didn’t see in the documentation – some solution for mailing lists and mail subscriptions. How are these supposed to work in your scheme?</p>

	<p>On a more general note, this is one of the “boil the ocean” solutions. It will only give users an advantage if a significant number of people (let’s say > 20% of all email users) uses it. Until then there are numerous disadvantages however. First of all, there is metadata associated with the contact’s address so that transferring this address to another email client is problematic. This metadata is dependent on your email address (at least I assume this, otherwise instead of selling email addresses to spammers you would be able to simply sell email address + relationship key instead), so if you change your address you will have to re-request relationship permission from all your contacts. And of course many email clients won’t add support for it until there are sufficient users – and who wants to be limited in his choice of email clients?</p>

	<p>There are far more problems, for example there seem to be a few security issues with the protocol (that’s probably only bad documentation). But I think there is no point discussing them until there is a clear specification (something one can suggest improvements for) and some idea on how to transition all current email users (which mainly means eliminating the disadvantages of participation or at least equaling them out with some advantages). And btw, if your goal is to improve email then “forms, photo albums, tasks and calendars, file sharing” aren’t going to help you. They will make the transition more problematic (e.g. because adding support to existing mail clients will be more difficult).</p>
