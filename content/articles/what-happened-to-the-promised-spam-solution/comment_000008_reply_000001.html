<p>There are mainly two reasons. First, these headers containing the IP address can be spoofed. While you can&#8217;t affect the headers from the mail server you are using to send the message, you can add some headers of your own. The spoofed headers are usually easily recognizable but this makes an automated solution difficult at best. Then, unfortunately not all ISPs will react to a complaint or it will take them too long to react. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Internet/Abuse/Spam/Blacklists/" rel="nofollow" >blacklists</a> have been established &#8211; you can report spam there and mails from the offending IPs will be blocked automatically (assuming that your mail provider uses one of those blacklists). The blacklists also give ISPs more incentive to fix the problem (on the other hand, blacklists also enjoy a bad reputation because of false positives). Problem however is, that with a botnet large enough you can send every spam mail from a different IP address. And blocking the infected computers (typically home users) won&#8217;t bring you far.</p>

	<p>As to the other question &#8211; users do not always use spam filters by choice. Most major web mail services have spam protection switched on by default for example. And even if somebody really switched on spam protection, he might get interested in the offer if some clever social engineering subject gets him to read the mail in the first place. Don&#8217;t forget that sending spam is very cheap, so even if the chances are very low it is still worth it.</p>
