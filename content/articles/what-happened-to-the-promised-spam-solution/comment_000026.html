	<p>I&#8217;m no expert on this, and I&#8217;m sure there is a good reason why the following isn&#8217;t implemented. Doesn&#8217;t every e-mail have a traceable header stamped with an IP address from every server it goes through? So why can&#8217;t someone develop an automated complaint program that reads the header, looks up the originating server from a Whois database, and make a complaint to the <span class="caps">ISP</span> provider? Hopefully then the <span class="caps">ISP</span> will look up who was using that IP address and shut down their account.<br />
Also I am wondering what is the motivation for spammers to defeat <span class="caps">SPAM</span> filters? If someone is using a filter then obviously they aren&#8217;t interested in the products spammers offer. So then why waste your time trying to circumvent filters to deliver advertisements to people that will not buy your product? Are they hoping that just one more spam will finally win you over??</p>
