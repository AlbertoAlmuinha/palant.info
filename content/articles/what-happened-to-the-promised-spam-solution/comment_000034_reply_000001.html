<p>I guess you are talking about EmailXT &#8211; there is currently nothing to be built into Thunderbird. This idea isn&#8217;t thought through well enough and in its current state doesn&#8217;t have the slightest chance to succeed. A clear specification might change my opinion though I have my doubts here.</p>
