	<p>When I hear stuff like : </p>

	<p>{OTOH: Gates-bashing isn’t as appropriate for the media as it was some years ago, when everybody was suffering under the weirdnesses of Word 6.0 and Windows 95. Bill Gates in 2006 is one of the biggest benefactors of (African) mankind, donating vast amounts of money exceeding the WHO’s budget to health research, and literally saves thousands of lifes. One could argue that these donations stem from license fees gained by selling an inferior product to a monopolized world.</p>

	<p>It just makes my skin crawl. So many good, inventive companies were trashed, bought out, bought and killed, <br />
absorbed, crushed using borderline legal, flagrantly not and pure street bully techniques that this guy and his company would have to repay twice the full value of all their ill gotten gains and further renounce ever going into business again as penance. I don&#8217;t care how much money this guy spends or where, he can&#8217;t buy his way into heaven. For all the trashing and smashing he has done in the past, there is no exemption on his fate.</p>
