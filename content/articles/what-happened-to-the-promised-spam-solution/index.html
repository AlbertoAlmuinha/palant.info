	<p>Do you still remember? Sometime in the beginning of year 2004 Bill Gates <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/24/tech/main595595.shtml">promised us to take care of the spam problem by 2006</a>. It was big in the news all over the world. Well, the year is almost over and I don&#8217;t see anything change for the better. A look at my inbox tells me that spam got much worse if anything. In fact, spammers have made considerable progress in these two years. They are now making heavy use of botnets thus rendering the spam protection methods based on IP address checks or identity verification almost irrelevant. They successfully use randomized mail content and images to trick Bayesian filters. And they got much better at social engineering. What did Microsoft do? They sued a few spammers&nbsp;&mdash; which didn&#8217;t quite make the expected impact because spam is still much too profitable.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that I really expected them to find the silver bullet. I mean, it was obvious that Bill Gates was selling hot air there. But I miss the public outcry. Where are the newspapers who reported about this two years ago, do they want to let him simply get away with a lie?</p>
