	<p>Wladimir, I am the project leader of EmailXT.</p>

	<p>EmailXT is a new email protocol that aims to solve its current problems and add new features. It makes email private, defeats any non-authorized bulk emailing (no spam), and stops viruses from spreading. It is based on relationships and has a self-updating address book. With its automatic delivery receipts you always know if your message reached its intended recipient. Check other features at the EmailXT website.</p>

	<p>It’s compatible with today’s email infrastructure, so to adopt EmailXT you just need a compatible app.</p>

	<p>This is a work in progress (currently at v0.1). Upcoming features are protocol extensions like forms, photo albums, tasks and calendars, file sharing.</p>

	<p>Along with the protocol, an official email client named InfinityXT is made available, currently at a pre-alpha stage (v0.13).</p>

	<p>Maybe you could take a look at it.</p>
