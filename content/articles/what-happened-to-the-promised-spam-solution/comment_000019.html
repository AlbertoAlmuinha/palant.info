	<p>From my point of view, the spam topic is a matter of the past. Admitted, I receive about 100 spam messages a day. But approximately zero of them hit my inbox, due to the near-perfect abilities of GMail to separate the good, the bad and the ugly. So, to quote Frank ‘n’ Furter of Rocky Horror fame, they have “not cured the cause, but the symptom.” Which is good enough for me.</p>

	<p>OTOH: Gates-bashing isn’t as appropriate for the media as it was some years ago, when everybody was suffering under the weirdnesses of Word 6.0 and Windows 95. Bill Gates in 2006 is one of the biggest benefactors of (African) mankind, donating vast amounts of money exceeding the WHO’s budget to health research, and literally saves thousands of lifes. One could argue that these donations stem from license fees gained by selling an inferior product to a monopolized world. </p>

	<p>But then again, he wouldn’t have it to donate anyway.</p>
