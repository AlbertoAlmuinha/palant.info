<p>Add-on developers aren&#8217;t Asa&#8217;s job, Asa lacks the knowledge for that. In fact, informing add-on developers is a task spread out between core developers, <span class="caps">MDN</span> and <span class="caps">AMO</span>. There is no single person with the job description being &#8220;think about implications of our changes for add-ons developers and communicate them&#8221; and unfortunately, we had several important changes lately where nobody did think them through properly. Add-on developers themselves tend to notice the issues far too late, when a release is getting close and code stability requirements prevent any significant changes.</p>
