	<p>Asa is getting paid to be community liaison right? There are many stakeholders that can be considered under the label &#8216;community&#8217; including Add-On developers using binary components. If these valued contributors to the &#8216;community&#8217; are not being informed of key changes to the Firefox codebase that will effect them, is Asa failing to do his job? Add that to his enormous &#8216;enterprise&#8217; gaffe and do we get a good case for firing him?</p>
