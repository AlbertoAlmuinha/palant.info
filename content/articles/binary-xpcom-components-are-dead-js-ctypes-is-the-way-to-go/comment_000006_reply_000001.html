<p>Firefox has serious competition now, that&#8217;s an entirely different game than its first five years. That might be a good thing for the web but it made MoCo even more focused on Firefox and market share than it always was. I see lots of pressure being built up &#8211; Mozilla needs to deliver fast, even if sacrifices have to be made. Rather than investing into the platform or the ecosystem Mozilla is increasingly investing into short-term goals. One is regularly being reminded that Mozilla&#8217;s &#8220;customers&#8221; are end-users and not add-on developers. There were already signs of this during Firefox 4 development (e.g. the toolbar icon disaster that was luckily averted). The &#8220;slow add-ons initiative&#8221; was another important sign, a masterpiece of miscommunication and negligence. And there are many smaller signs that it is now ok to screw third-parties if that allows Firefox to move faster. No, I don&#8217;t really care whether companies will continue using Firefox &#8211; but I am very concerned if they get &#8220;piss off&#8221; as an answer.</p>
