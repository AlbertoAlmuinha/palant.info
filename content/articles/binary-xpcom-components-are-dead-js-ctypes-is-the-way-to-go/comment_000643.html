	<p>While we haven&#8217;t done a dedicated blog post on the topic because of the very few add-ons on <span class="caps">AMO</span> that use binary components, our posts on the the topic of compatibility have mentioned that binary components need to be recompiled with every version: http://blog.mozilla.com/addons?s=binary</p>

	<p>Additionally, in the compatibility bump email notifications, any binary add-ons are told that we could not bump them because they must recompile binary components with every release.</p>

	<p>Second only to non-hosted add-ons, binary add-ons are the biggest compatibility problem with moving to rapid releases. It&#8217;s very unfortunate that they have to be recompiled and we are encouraging authors to move to js-ctypes when they can. Kev has been reaching out to all of the most popular binary add-on companies (such as toolbars and antivirus add-ons) for many months warning of what&#8217;s to come and encouraging a move to js-ctypes.</p>
