	<p>Well, communicating breaking changes to the add-on developer community is a very well-defined part of my job.</p>

	<p>Learning about those breaking changes from the development team is where it gets complicated. I have to go over bug lists every 6 weeks, trying to identify those that affect us. It has been pretty effective in general, but it&#8217;s very dependent on bugs having descriptive summaries.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s also difficult for Firefox developers to assess which bugs will affect us or not. Pretty much any (<span class="caps">IDL</span>) interface or UI change can potentially do this, so I can understand why this isn&#8217;t on every developer&#8217;s mind at the moment. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re working on.</p>
