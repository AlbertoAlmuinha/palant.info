<p>Yes, they are definitely on path to extinction &#8211; Moz <span class="caps">SDK</span> is increasingly becoming something for application builders only (meaning mainly Mozilla itself), not for extension developers. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you restrict yourself only to the most basic and stable interfaces, recompiling for each new Firefox release is now a feature of the platform. I think that Mozilla has given up on binary <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> interfaces for anything other than connecting libraries within Firefox itself. They are streamlining everything to stay competitive in the changed browser landscape, and binary <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> components are far more trouble than they are worth. This is only one part of an overall tendency, it looks like &#8220;the Mozilla platform&#8221; is generally going away to be replaced by &#8220;the Firefox application&#8221;. Maybe I&#8217;m just pessimistic as you say but I don&#8217;t like the current course at all (and it isn&#8217;t because of the rapid releases).</p>
