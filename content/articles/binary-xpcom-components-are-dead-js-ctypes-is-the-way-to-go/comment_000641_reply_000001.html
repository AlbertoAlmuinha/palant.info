<p>Yes, allowing very powerful add-ons is probably the most significant advantage that Firefox has over Chrome. I don&#8217;t think that anybody would be stupid enough to pursue dumbing down the Firefox extension system to the sad level where Chrome is right now. Then again, some statements make it look like Mozilla plans to neglect &#8220;traditional&#8221; add-ons &#8211; to the point where supporting them becomes too much effort. I sincerely hope that this is a wrong impression.</p>
