<p>You are being unfair to Mitchell Baker &#8211; she has been doing a great job and organizational questions like this one aren&#8217;t her responsibility. Anyway, if you bother to open the Wikipedia page on her you will notice that she is a lawyer, regardless of her hobbies, and that she no longer holds a post within MoCo.</p>

	<p>Some people did spend some thoughts on how to organize communication with the add-on developers given the rapid release process. The current proposal is that core developers report any changes that might affect extensions. <span class="caps">AMO</span> then feeds that information into the add-on validator and alerts add-on authors that might be affected. Whether this approach works better (or at all) is still unknown at this point. At least I haven&#8217;t seen anybody comment on the results after Firefox 5 release &#8211; maybe we will get more info once Firefox 6 is released.</p>
