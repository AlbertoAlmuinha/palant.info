title: Binary XPCOM components are dead - js-ctypes is the way to go
---

<p>Daniel Glazman is <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?post/2011/07/12/I-still-don-t-understand">shocked</a> to see how hard shipping binary <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> components with an extension became now. Fact is, we simply didn&#8217;t notice the hidden message of blog posts announcing dropping binary compatibility (meaning that your component needs to be recompiled for each new Firefox version, no matter how simple it is) and rapid releases&nbsp;&mdash; binary <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> components in extensions are deprecated. Theoretically, somebody could still continue using them but it requires so much effort that nobody can be expected to do that. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t seen it said like that anywhere, hence this blog post. There is still tons of documentation on binary <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> components on <span class="caps">MDN</span> and no deprecation warnings. Even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0"><span class="caps">XPCOM</span> changes in Gecko 2.0</a> page lists all the important changes without making any conclusions.</p>

	<p>In reality, as an author of an extension that relies on binary code you should start looking at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/js-ctypes">js-ctypes</a>. If the point of a binary component was simply calling some platform functions&nbsp;&mdash; js-ctypes can do that for you. If you require some native code (e.g. for cryptography functions that would be too slow in JavaScript)&nbsp;&mdash; you can move it into a regular native library and ship that library with your extension. If you do that, don&#8217;t forget adding <code>&lt;em:unpack&gt;true&lt;/em:unpack&gt;</code> to your extension&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Install_Manifests#unpack">install manifest</a>, the library can only be loaded if it is unpacked into a file on disk. Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Addons/Add-on_Manager/AddonManager#getAddonByID%28%29">AddonManager.getAddonByID()</a> and then <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Addons/Add-on_Manager/Addon#getResourceURI%28%29">Addon.getResourceURI()</a> to locate the library on disk and open it with js-ctypes.</p>
