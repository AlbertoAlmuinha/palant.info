	<p>Not to be too cynical but this is hardly anything new. Mozilla announced in May 2007 that they were essentially abandoning the platform (<span class="caps">XULR</span>unner). To be fair, it&#8217;s a very difficult line to tread since producing a high-quality platform will necessarily take away from the end-user perception of the browser. Also, I understand why they are frustrated by perceptions that Firefox is slower and/or more of a memory hog than Chrome to the extent that this is due to misbehaving add-ons and not the core platform.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless I think Firefox add-on ecosystem is its only long-term competitive advantage in the newly challenging browser market you rightly point to. It&#8217;s a very complex issue and I need to think and blog about it as well.</p>
