	<p>Wladimir, we&#8217;re heavily investing into the <em>platform</em>.  The problem is that investment in the platform and &#8220;don&#8217;t change anything&#8221; are mutually contradictory, and a lot of people seem to be looking for the latter&#8230;.</p>

	<p>Now there&#8217;s the separate issue of how easy the platform is to build on if what you&#8217;re building is not a webapp.  In some ways, what&#8217;s going on is that building webapps is becoming simpler and they&#8217;re becoming more powerful.  To the extent that this happens and that webapps like that can replace <span class="caps">XUL</span> addons, it&#8217;s OK to deprecate <span class="caps">XUL</span> addons slowly.  Of course that means deprecating the less powerful ones that weren&#8217;t hooked deep into the system anyway.</p>
