	<p>Ok for thirs-party binary libs even if js-ctypes can be really painful, in particular for multi-platform add-ons having one 2rd-party underlying lib per platform. But what about &#8220;native&#8221; xpcom components entirely built based on Moz <span class="caps">SDK</span>? Do you also think they&#8217;re on path to extinction?!? Every now and then, my components stop building. It&#8217;s already a huge pain, changes are rarely documented, the xpcom examples are not up to date, but these components are still extremely useful&#8230;</p>
