	<p>Pretty much every Flash movie on the web today uses Flash Player&#8217;s global storage feature to store data on your disk, similar to regular browser cookies. What makes this feature so problematic is the lack of proper control mechanisms. For example, for browser cookies I selected &#8220;Keep until I close Firefox&#8221; which makes sure that cookies can be set (no site functionality is broken) but won&#8217;t survive too long. But this setting won&#8217;t apply to Flash data. Same goes for the Private Browsing mode in Firefox 3.1, it has absolutely no effect on Flash. Note also that Flash data is the same for all browsers and all profiles.</p>

	<p>Now theoretically you can <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">change Flash settings</a> to address this problem. Of course this feature is so well-hidden that I doubt anybody ever uses it. Still, when I tried all I got was constant nagging: &#8220;Do you want to allow this site to write data to your disk?&#8221; Honestly, is it so hard to add a &#8220;never allow&#8221; option? Not to mention that even with the most restrictive settings Flash continues to remember which sites I visited (again, clearing browser history or Private Browsing mode have no effect). But these settings break many sites nevertheless.</p>

	<p>Altogether, it doesn&#8217;t look like Flash developers put much thought into ensuring user&#8217;s privacy. My solution might be somewhat drastic but I don&#8217;t see any alternative until Flash improves (ideally that would mean exposing its storage to the browser so that usual cookie settings can be applied to it, they should at least give users usable options however). I wrote a tiny <span class="caps">WSH</span> script to remove the Macromedia directory:</p>

<pre><code>var FSO = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;);
var Shell = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;Wscript.Shell&quot;);
try {
  FSO.DeleteFolder(Shell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(&quot;%APPDATA%\\Macromedia&quot;), true);
} catch(e) {} // don&#39;t care if folder wasn&#39;t found
</code></pre>

	<p>Then I scheduled a task to run it every five minutes:</p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/8265/scheduler.png" width="1180" height="455"/></p>

	<p>Now all sites work again, I&#8217;m not nagged with stupid questions and nevertheless Flash data isn&#8217;t stored. Perfect, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
