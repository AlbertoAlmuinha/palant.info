<p>well you are absolutly right,,,forgive me!</p>

	<p>my customers use mac, windows, linux, or &#8220;other&#8221; setups<br />
so i need something that will work in all setups or can be adapted to them </p>

	<p>i use 98 or what ever will stay out of my way while i work <br />
and can be reloaded with a minimum of time/effort <br />
i use bartpe, linux, <span class="caps">QNX</span>,  etc to fix systems for a living <br />
95% xp or vista </p>

	<p>and the request for user action allows the user to <br />
fix the hard coded paths and is a CoverMyAss thing </p>

	<p>your script ,, does it work in 95 98 9x nt 2k xp vista?<br />
i am ignorant of the answer ,, mine requires a <span class="caps">LFN</span>  command <br />
and can  be used if altered for the system i put it on</p>
