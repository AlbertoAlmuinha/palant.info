	<p>&#8220;Now theoretically you can change Flash settings to address this problem. Of course this feature is so well-hidden that I doubt anybody ever uses it. Still, when I tried all I got was constant nagging: “Do you want to allow this site to write data to your disk?”&#8221; </p>

	<p>No nagging if you select &#8220;Never Ask Again&#8221;.<br />
I have selected that.<br />
And then on some sites that don&#8217;t load flash because Local Storage is off, like: spike.com and metacafe.com, i right-click on a flash video, click the &#8220;Settings&#8230;&#8221; and give them 10KB.</p>

	<p>Works fine here. And i dont care if then few sites have Flash cookies. I think i have allowed 4 or 5 sites.</p>
