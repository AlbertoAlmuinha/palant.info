	<p>I&#8217;d rather wrap the Firefox startup script with it in order to simulate &#8220;Session Cookies&#8221;. I&#8217;d be a bit wary of a cron job deleting the cookies from under the feet of the running flash applets. It might work most of the time, but fail with unforseen and hard to debug problems.</p>
