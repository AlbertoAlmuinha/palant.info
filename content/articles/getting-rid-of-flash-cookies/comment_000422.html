	<p>Hi Wladimir thanks a lot for the script. </p>

	<p>It took me a while to get it working though as I was following the settings in your screenshots exactly.</p>

	<p>In the end I figured out it was the start in field causing problems, instead of:</p>

	<p>c:\scripts</p>

	<p>it should be:</p>

	<p>c:\scripts\</p>

	<p>This small change got the task manager correctly triggering the script for me.</p>
