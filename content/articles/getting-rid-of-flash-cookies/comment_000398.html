<p>For ages now&#8212;ever since I realized the Flash Settings panel doesn&#8217;t do a damn thing&#8212;I&#8217;ve kept the following OS 10.5.6. User folders locked, to no ill effects whatsoever:</p>

	<p>~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash     Player/macromedia.com/support/flashplayer/sys</p>

	<p>and ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects/{folder}</p>

	<p>No more crap to empty.</p>
