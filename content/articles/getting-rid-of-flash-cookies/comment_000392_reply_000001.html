<p>I need a very basic thing &#8211; get rid of Flash cookies (something that should have been possible with Flash itself but isn&#8217;t for reasons that are beyond me). Both Better Privacy and Objection (but especially Better Privacy) do a lot more, things that I don&#8217;t need and that I even find questionable. I always choose the extensions I install very carefully because the browser is an essential tool for me and needs to be stable/fast. These two extensions just aren&#8217;t useful/safe enough to make my list.</p>

	<p>Besides, I close my browser very rarely, once a week at most.</p>
