	<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that flash <span class="caps">LSO</span> settings can be reset to the default withought your knowledge.  I haven&#8217;t determined exactly what sites can do this, but I have noticed that periodically the settings are changed to allow <span class="caps">LSO</span>s.  Relying on Flash <span class="caps">LSO</span> settings is useless.</p>

	<p>The only solution is something external that can wipe the files or changing permissions on the flash directories.  Both options break some sites, but not as many as you think.</p>
