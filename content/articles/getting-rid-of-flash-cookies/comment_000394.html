	<p><span class="caps">AFAIK</span>, the only other functions in Better Privacy are disabling of <span class="caps">DOM</span> storage and disabling ping tracking. Fx itself can be set to dom.sotrage.enabled = false. NoScript provides block of &lt;a ping&gt;, and even the option to allow it on your trusted sites while disallowing on all others, if you wish. So you can uncheck these two options in Fx &gt; Tools &gt; Better Privacy &gt; Options, and then you will be left with only <span class="caps">LSO</span> removal, as you wished for. If you don&#8217;t close the browser often enough, you can set a timer if you like, including warnings before <span class="caps">LSO</span> deletion. (Personally, I close my browser frequently to ensure trash cleanup. To each, their own.) </p>

	<p>Before I found Objection and then BP, I just made a desktop shortcut to the #SharedObjects folder. Anytime I wanted to delete, 2-click and empty. You can choose whether to point this shortcut only to <span class="caps">LSO</span> and preserve your settings.sol, or point it to Flash Player and delete all. So perhaps this should be your preferred choice?</p>
