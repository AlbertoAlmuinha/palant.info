	<p>Hello Wladimir, I was just viewing your site and learning about Adblock Plus. I have checked your Blog and the top comment is about &#8220; Getting rid of Flash Cookies&#8221;<br />
I left clicked on &#8220; Change Flash Settings&#8221; and got the Adobe Settings Manager. Have you checked it lately?<br />
There IS a &#8220; Never Allow Option&#8221; or doesn&#8217;t it do all you want?<br />
This is all new to me as I thought deleting Cookies did it all but after reading your Blog you have me worried.<br />
