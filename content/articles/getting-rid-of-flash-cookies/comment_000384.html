<p>I fiddled with it some more using justin.tv as a test subject. Ended up denying only <em>List Folder/Read Data</em> to Everyone. Oddly enough, that is good enough for Flash Player. Apparently, it only cares about being able to write something, but it doesn&#8217;t actually need to read it for justin.tv to work.</p>

	<p>On <em>Macromedia</em> folder, go to <em>Security</em> tab -&gt; <em>Advanced</em> -&gt; <em>Add</em>, select <em>Everyone</em>, click <em>Deny</em> for <em>List Folder/Read Data</em>.</p>

	<p>Flash Player will then be able to write Flash cookies, but not read them.</p>
