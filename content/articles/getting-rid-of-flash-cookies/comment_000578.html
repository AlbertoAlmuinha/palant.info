<p>Hi,</p>

	<p>This is a really dumb question but as a newbie I have no idea how to copy/install and use your <span class="caps">WSH</span> script for Flash Cookies. I would very much like to use it, as these Flash Cookies and the other Macromedia individual web site alternative are driving me crazy. Can you please explain the basics for a 5 year old to make use of your great efforts here..</p>

	<p>I apologies again for my newbieness.</p>
