	<p>Using the freeware utility CCleaner ( www . ccleaner . com ) <br />
you can target the SharedObjects folder contents for deletion (star dot star filemask) (and any other paths you wish). It can be set to run at each Startup, and/or you can run it on-demand at any time (adds a right-click command to the RecycleBin context menu).<br />
The app <span class="caps">ALSO</span> enables you to target various browser caches/cookies (and the infernal <span class="caps">MSIE</span> index.dat file). For 
 any files currently locked / in use, it marks them &#8220;pending deletion&#8221; so they are deleted upon next startup.</p>

	<p>related note:<br />
another freeware app, MozillaCacheViewer, from ( www . nirsoft . com ) is the best app I&#8217;ve found for viewing and drag/drop extracting Mozilla cached files. (Tip: in order to delete files from the Mozilla disk cache, you must close the browser before launching the viewer utility.)</p>
