	<p>Thanks for the inspiration. I made a script and put it into my start folder, so it is executed every boot (for me this means at least once daily). </p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t see, that Adobe will improve this. With flash audio this is the same problem. There is no easy way to lower/mute it globally. But Adobes (paying) customers aren&#8217;t the normal users; the advertising companies fill pockets. So they will never change this.</p>
