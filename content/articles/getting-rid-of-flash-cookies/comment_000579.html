<p>Hi,</p>

	<p>Thanks for getting back to me. I already have BetterPrivacy installed in Firefox.</p>

	<p>Since posting I search around a bit on the Internet and then, &gt;highlighted the script in the box above &gt; copied it and pasted it into notepad &gt;saved it as a js file and &gt; then copied pretty much what was on the the screens shots in your blog above. Did however make a sub folder in C:\Scripts\SubFolder and saved the js script to there and start &gt; control panel &gt; scheduled tasks &gt; add scheduled task &gt; followed your setting.</p>

	<p>Macromedia folder/directory in C:\Documents and Settings\XXXmeXXX\Application Data\Macromedia is gone and although BetterPrivacy shows FlashCookies when I shut down Firefox it complains that No Flash Cookies can be found so I guess it must be working.</p>

	<p>Have noticed another folder/directory listed under C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Macromedia and not sure what to do with that? Renamed it by Adding <span class="caps">ADMIN</span> on the end of Macromedia i.e MacromediaAdmin but I will look into whether I should just delete it?</p>

	<p>Thanks for your efforts.</p>

	<p>laopa</p>
