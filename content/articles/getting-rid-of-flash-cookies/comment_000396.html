<p>recommend my solution </p>

	<p>deny  write permission , yourcurrently acc. with system block folder&amp;subfolders&amp;files to  appdata/adobe/flash player ,macromedia/flash player<br />
so ur acc. can not create any thing, your browser too <br />
dnt forget first delete that files:D</p>

	<p>when need something to write this folder (i not know why?) take  replace owner&#8230;</p>
