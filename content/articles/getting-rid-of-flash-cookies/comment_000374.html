	<p>I hate dealing with Flash cookies.  I use Pandora.com and am constantly dealing with the build-up of other Flash crap, while trying to avoid deleting Pandora.com cookies.  It&#8217;s not a huge deal to wipe out Pandora.com&#8217;s cookies, but it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to have to log in and reconfigure the player every time.</p>

	<p>Yet surprisingly enough, I have <span class="caps">NEVER</span> seen an application or extension that automates this.</p>

	<p>I tried a batch file kludge in which I copy off the wanted Flash cookies, wipe out the remaining directories, then copy it back, but haven&#8217;t gotten it to work yet.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s this kind of crap that makes me want to punch shitty engineers in the throat.</p>
