title: 'Underestimated issue: Hashing passwords without salts'
---

<p>My <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/easy-passwords/">Easy Passwords extension</a> is quickly climbing up in popularity, right now it already ranks 9th in <a href="/2016/04/20/security-considerations-for-password-generators#overview">my list of password generators</a> (yay!). In other words, it already has 80 users (well, that was anticlimatic). At least, looking at this list I realized that I missed one threat scenario in my security analysis of these extensions, and that I probably rated UniquePasswordBuilder too high.</p>

<p>The problem is that somebody could get hold of a significant number of passwords, either because they are <a href="http://xkcd.com/792/">hosting a popular service</a> or because a popular service leaked all their passwords. Now they don&#8217;t know of course which of the passwords have been generated with a password generator. However, they don&#8217;t need to: they just take a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2014-were-all-doomed-1680596951">list of most popular passwords</a>. Then they try using each password as a master password and derive a site-specific password for the service in question. Look it up in the database, has this password been ever used? If there is a match&nbsp;&mdash; great, now they know who is using a password generator and what their master password is.</p>

<p>This approach is easiest with password generators using a weak hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA1, lots of hashes can be calculated quickly and within a month pretty much every password will be cracked. However, even with UniquePasswordBuilder that uses a comparably strong hash this approach allows saving lots of time. The attacker doesn&#8217;t need to bruteforce each password individually, they can rather crack all of them in parallel. Somebody is bound to use a weak master password, and they don&#8217;t even need to know in advance who that is.</p>

<p>How does one protect himself against this attack? Easy: the generated password shouldn&#8217;t depend on master password and website only, there should also be a user-specific salt parameter. This makes sure that, even if the attacker can guess the salt, they have to re-run the calculation for each single user&nbsp;&mdash; simply because the same master password will result in different generated passwords for different users. Luckily, UniquePasswordBuilder is the only extension where I gave a good security rating despite missing salts. Easy Passwords and <span class="caps">CCTOO</span> have user-defined salts, and hash0 even generates truly random salts.</p>
