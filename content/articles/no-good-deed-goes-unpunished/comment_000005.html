	<p>Another problem of the Mozilla Add-ons page is that there are these spam toolbars, the ones where users with few knowledge of Firefox&#8217;s own capabilities think: &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a got a popup blocker, let&#8217;s install it!&#8221;. I mean, no one really needs an <strong>additional</strong> popup blocker or search bar in Firefox and for <span class="caps">RSS</span> and email notification there are better extensions which don&#8217;t &#8220;<cite>send anonymous usage stats</cite>&#8220; to Conduit.<br />
However, the extension authors by default put these toolbars in all of the categories, so that every user will see their all too long descriptions (these texts aren&#8217;t even cut to shorten the page).</p>

	<p>The problem with bugs is something which probably goes for extension that store their settings on a server, like bookmarking services or something, hopefully. I never install those extensions &#8230; but I&#8217;ve got a lot of other extensions.</p>
