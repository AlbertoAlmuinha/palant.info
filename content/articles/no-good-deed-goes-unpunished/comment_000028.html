	<p>This is scary! I&#8217;m kind of paranoid anyway and this doesn&#8217;t set well with me. What would you recommend for users to do to watch out for bad extensions? Users like me that like them but don&#8217;t know any programming? Something we can look for in the code? If you don&#8217;t want to publish it, I&#8217;d love to get an email about it from you/someone/anyone that knows. Thanks.</p>
