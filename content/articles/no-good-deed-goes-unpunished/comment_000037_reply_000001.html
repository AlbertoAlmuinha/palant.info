	<p>The problem with the extensions isn&#8217;t as bad as with ActiveX &#8211; Windows comes with lots of ActiveX controls pre-installed and a malicious website can really rely on these controls being there. On the other hand, Firefox doesn&#8217;t have any extensions by default and I guess that not more than 20% of all Firefox users have any extensions installed at all. Another issue with ActiveX that Firefox extensions don&#8217;t have is that most of those ActiveX controls were never meant to be used from the web and were not designed with security in mind.</p>

	<p>But of course, with the popularity of both Firefox and extensions increasing, we might see malicious sites specifically targeting popular extensions. But I think we still have years before that happens &#8211; time that we should use.</p>
