	<p>Thats right, It did scared me. suddenly i feel that all those security issues that plagued IE/ActiveX duo will surface for FF as well. Just a matter of time is it.</p>

	<p>but i don&#8217;t think shutting down <span class="caps">AMO</span> is a good or rather practical solution to it anyway. Part of firefox popularity is because of single unified extensions source. secondly shutting down <span class="caps">AMO</span> will cut only source but not the problem itself.</p>

	<p>I think we need something like <span class="caps">PMD</span> for extensions.</p>
