<p>These sites don&#8217;t scan for malware but rather for known virus signatures. A generic recognition of malware is impossible (defining the term &#8220;malware&#8221; is hard enough in words already). Scanning for viruses in extensions is pointless since extensions aren&#8217;t compiled. And even if <span class="caps">AMO</span> would create a &#8220;malware&#8221; scanner, it would be easy to circumvent it (<span class="caps">AMO</span> is open source so anybody could check what they scan for). Automated scanning for possible vulnerabilities on the other hand is something that could be done &#8211; and will be done, hopefully soon. But it will only catch the most obvious things of course, e.g. extensions that are vulnerable by concept (Firefoxit is an example) usually cannot be recognized automatically.</p>
