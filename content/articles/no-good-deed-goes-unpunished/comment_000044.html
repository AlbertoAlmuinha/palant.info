<p>Hi..</p>

	<p>I am not computer wiz and unfamiliar with much on my computer and learning. I use Firefox and like it. I did however place the Addon  <span class="caps">ADBLOCK</span> which I want to remove it. But I don&#8217;t know how to remove it from my computer. Any suggestions to help me please. Thank you.</p>
