	<p>pc1oad1etter, since most of the JS-property-to-<span class="caps">DOM</span>-attribute sugar is implemented via <span class="caps">XBL</span> setters, you need to wait until that element has been added to the document, the document is open, and the element isn&#8217;t essentially &#8220;display: none;&#8221;.</p>
