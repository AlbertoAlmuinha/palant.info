	<p>&#8220;Four years later there is still no mechanism to share a single <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner installation between multiple applications&#8221; </p>

	<p>Sure there is, just run `firefox -app /path/to/XULapp/application.ini`</p>

	<p>I think this has amazing potential, it&#8217;s really a shame it hasn&#8217;t taken off.  Hundreds of millions of people have Firefox.  I and others would be far more likely to run Chatzilla/Songbird/InstantBird/etc. if they were smaller 4 MB downloads that shared my Firefox runtime, one that automatically updates and that is <strong>already running on my computer</strong>.</p>

	<p>This would mean app developers are tied to Firefox, but as you point out, <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner is almost completely determined by Firefox&#8217;s needs anyway :-(</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve read some blog posts about Thunderbird and SeaMonkey that suggest devs are considering running them &#8220;from Firefox&#8221;: <span class="caps">IMO</span> the -app switch is the way to do it.</p>

	<p>Firefox: the browser that&#8217;s also a platform for extensions, for Prism web apps, and for cool standalone applications.</p>
