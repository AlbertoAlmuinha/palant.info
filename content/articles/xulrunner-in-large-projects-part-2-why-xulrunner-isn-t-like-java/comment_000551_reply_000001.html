<p>I&#8217;m not sure what kind of &#8220;out of the box capabilities&#8221; you expect. Generally I consider UI widgets to be an area where <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner is pretty well developed. You can have a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL_Reference" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL_Reference</a> &#8211; it even has widgets like datepicker/colorpicker. The way I remember other UI libraries, that&#8217;s pretty much how far you go as built-in widgets go. But I don&#8217;t know Flex of course.</p>
