	<p>Well having just read this article, I could forgive myself for thinking that the application platform I&#8217;ve been using for the past few years called &#8220;<span class="caps">XULR</span>unner&#8221; is different to the one described here.</p>

	<p>There is so much in this article that is wrong, inaccurate, and just plain not true it&#8217;s scary (and that includes the some of the comments).</p>

	<p>A few inaccuracies have been addressed, but on your <span class="caps">TCP</span> sockets remark it most certainly is not new:</p>

	<p>And XulPlanet has been dead for what 3 years maybe?</p>

	<p>As for .NET &#8211; well this effectively give you the .NET <span class="caps">API</span> inside XR apps: http://www.redbacksystems.com/xulu/ </p>

	<p>As for the comment about toy projects, my current XR app is well over 40,000 lines of JS across multiple extensions &#8211; it loads in less than 35 MB <span class="caps">RAM</span> and starts almost as quickly as Google Chrome.  </p>

	<p>I knocked up an Internet TV demo for a client the other day using the XR 2.0 beta, it took me 3 days and that included embedding <span class="caps">VLC</span> and writing a Flash player plugin in AS3 from scratch.</p>

	<p>Seriously&#8230;. what is you want from an internet platform?</p>
