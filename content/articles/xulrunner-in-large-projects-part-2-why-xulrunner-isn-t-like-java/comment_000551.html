	<p>Is <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner mature enough for competitive rich interfaces? For example Flex provides very dynamic <span class="caps">GUI</span> out of the box. (I.e. one can implement a <span class="caps">GUI</span> in Flex/ActionScript, and backend in a language of choice &#8211; C++, Java etc.). Same is possible with <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner in theory (<span class="caps">GUI</span> in <span class="caps">XUL</span>/JavaScript, and backend in C++/Java etc. through <span class="caps">XPCOM</span>). But it seems that sole focus on Firefox limited the &#8220;out of the box&#8221; <span class="caps">GUI</span> capabilites of <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner comparing to other <span class="caps">GUI</span> <span class="caps">XML</span> based approaches (Qt has another for example). Or this impression is not correct?</p>
