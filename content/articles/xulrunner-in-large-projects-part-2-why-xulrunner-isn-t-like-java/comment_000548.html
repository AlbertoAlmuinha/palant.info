	<p>The attribute/property thing was one of the earliest quirks that tripped me up.  Even after a year or two developing with it, and thinking that I somewhat understood how it worked, I still remember trying every permutation I could think of to properly create, set, unset values in some widget.</p>

	<p>My general thinking now is that you set the attribute before you add it to the document, and the value afterwards.*</p>

	<p>* Except when you don&#8217;t.</p>
