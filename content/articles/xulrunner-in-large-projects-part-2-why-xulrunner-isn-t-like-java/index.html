	<p>When talking about runtimes people often expect <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner to be something like Java. Sometimes people will also mention .NET&nbsp;&mdash; if you are one of them feel free to replace the word &#8220;Java&#8221; but &#8220;.NET&#8221; everywhere in this article, it shouldn&#8217;t affect the meaning in any way. Fact is, <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner is very different from Java and I will try to explain why.</p>

	<h4>No shared runtime</h4>

	<p>Originally there was talk about providing <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner as a shared runtime. The idea was that the user would only need to install <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner once and run different applications on top of it&nbsp;&mdash; much like it works with Java. Four years later there is still no mechanism to share a single <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner installation between multiple applications (Linux distributions are an exception here). And frankly, I don&#8217;t expect one to come up. Here some thoughts on what is required to turn <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner into a real shared runtime:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Create an installation/update mechanism for <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner that works independently of applications.</li>
		<li>Create a packaging format for applications similar to the <span class="caps">XPI</span> format for extensions.</li>
		<li>Add a simple mechanism to install applications into a runtime, ideally also a similar way to remove them.</li>
		<li>Find a way to deal with applications that are incompatible with the current runtime, probably install a second runtime automatically.</li>
		<li>Decide what to do if a security update is necessary for a runtime but some application isn&#8217;t compatible with it.</li>
		<li>Somehow make sure not to leave outdated runtimes on the computer (e.g. only keep runtime versions that are still supported with security updates).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If one starts thinking about how all this should be implemented it becomes clear that we are talking about a major effort. From what I&#8217;ve heard, Mozilla isn&#8217;t very interested in investing that amount of time into <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner because it won&#8217;t benefit Firefox directly. Rather there is hope that some other vendor of <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner-based applications will do it. But realistically speaking&nbsp;&mdash; why should they? It is much easier to package a private <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner copy with their installer.</p>

	<p>There is one more issue that makes the idea of shared <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner instances unrealistic. From what I know, no larger application uses <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner as it is provided by Mozilla. Instead, these applications always apply own patches to <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner. This isn&#8217;t very surprising given that Mozilla is mostly looking at Firefox when deciding when/how to fix issues. Other applications have different priorities and different schedules however, e.g. it is often necessary to apply a patch to a stable <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner branch that Mozilla only accepted for the trunk.</p>

	<h4>Special-purpose platform</h4>

	<p>Which brings us to the next point: <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner isn&#8217;t a general-purpose platform, its main purpose always was and stays Firefox. This means that <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner&#8217;s capabilities are very well-developed in the areas that Firefox needs, yet they are at best rudimentary in areas that Firefox doesn&#8217;t need. For example, <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner has generally excellent networking capabilities which is perfect for applications that communicate with the Internet a lot. Yet functionality like <span class="caps">TCP</span> server sockets or <del><span class="caps">FTP</span> uploads</del> is relatively new. And there is no built-in component for <span class="caps">UDP</span> communication other than <span class="caps">DNS</span>. One would think that all these capabilities are required for a complete platform, yet creating a complete platform was never the goal during <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner development.</p>

	<p>What does this mean for you? If the application you are developing is a browser&nbsp;&mdash; great, <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner will be perfect for you. If however you are developing something significantly different you should expect that some required capabilities will be missing. You can create your own components for these of course. However, you will often need C++ code then meaning that you have to make your own thoughts about cross-platform support. In this context <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/javascript_code_modules/ctypes.jsm">js-ctypes</a> is certainly something to look forward to, it might reduce the need for custom C++ code significantly.</p>

	<h4>Grown, not designed</h4>

	<p>The development of the platform that we can use with <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner started 13 years ago. During all that time it was growing &#8220;naturally&#8221;, depending on what capability was needed right now. There was little global oversight and platform consistency was certainly not a priority. This is the reason why, when converting between charsets, you have the choice between <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/uconv/idl/nsIUTF8ConverterService.idl">nsIUTF8ConverterService</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter">nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter</a> (hint: you should usually use the latter). Why for some notifications you register with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nsIObserverService#addObserver.28.29">nsIObserverService</a> but use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nsIWindowWatcher#registerNotification.28.29">nsIWindowWatcher</a> for others. Why <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/richlistbox">some <span class="caps">XUL</span> widgets</a> really aren&#8217;t good for keyboard navigation. Why sometimes you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/listitem#p-checked">a property of a <span class="caps">XUL</span> widget</a> while other times you can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/menuitem#a-checked">only set an attribute</a>.</p>

	<p>The good news: things are certainly improving and the platform is becoming more consistent. The bad news: things probably aren&#8217;t improving fast enough for you. So you will certainly hit the one or other unexpected issue. And then you will hopefully have the time to fix it so that other people no longer have to spend their time on it. Yes, Mozilla is a community project and the best way to get something fixed is fixing it.</p>
