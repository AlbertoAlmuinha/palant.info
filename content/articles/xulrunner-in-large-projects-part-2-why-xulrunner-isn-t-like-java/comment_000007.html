	<p>Poor <span class="caps">XUL</span>runner: almost a runtime but not really; Almost a <span class="caps">GUI</span> tool set but not really; Almost a write-once, deploy-many cross platform tool but not really. It must feel unloved. </p>

	<p>In terms of OS integration, nothing beats <span class="caps">XUL</span>runner. <span class="caps">GTK</span> looks good on Windows but not great. Java applications look and behave terribly in general on any platform. .Net just adds yet another <span class="caps">API</span> layer to the already bloated set of Windows stacks. If only there was an organisation out there that would support <span class="caps">XUL</span>runner&#8217;s long-term evolution. </p>

	<p>Most of those dot points do not seem insurmountable. Maybe if Mozilla cared more they could show enough leadership to generate a community behind <span class="caps">XUL</span>runner that could improve it substantially. Why has Mozilla never shown even that small level of support for <span class="caps">XUL</span>runner?</p>
