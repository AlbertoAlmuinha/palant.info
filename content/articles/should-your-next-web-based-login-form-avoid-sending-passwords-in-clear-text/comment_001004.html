<p>Not to mention that we user have no way to tell if the server does implement password hashing or not. Just like FaceBook case, everyone thought they had server-sided password hashing, but they didn't have. Why can't FB have some simple password hashing (scrypt probably) at client-side? Then, we users can be more confident to trust FB.</p>
