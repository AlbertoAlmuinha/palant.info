<p>If they are different hosts, CSP is still irrelevant - it either allows a third-party or not, it doesn't help with MITM or compromise of that host. SRI on the other hand solves the issue I mentioned in <a href="https://palant.de/2014/06/30/please-don-t-use-externally-hosted-javascript-libraries/" rel="nofollow">Please don't use externally hosted JavaScript libraries</a> six years ago, namely well-known libraries hosted on untrusted CDNs. I'd argue however that the more relevant issue here are third-party tracking/analytics scripts. Even if the website owner uses SRI to ensure that these don't change, expecting them to check every modification for malicious changes is unrealistic.</p>
