<p>If I'm reading your arguments correctly, the main one is that you can't trust that the javascript on the page hasn't been tampered with by a MITM or bad actor; I think the way to mitigate this would be to employ a Content Security Policy that prevents javascript from being run directly on the page; i.e., no script-src=self; Furthermore, you can have the server include Subresource Integrity checksums into the HTML of the page, which the browser will then verify match the checksums calculated for the downloaded javascript.</p>
<p>Using CSP, you can also assert that all scripts and styles on the page have SRIs, and then have the browser report back to your server or a reporting service when/if the SRIs fail or are missing.</p>
