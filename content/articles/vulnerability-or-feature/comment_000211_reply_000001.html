<p>Now that&#8217;s interesting &#8211; the important point being number 6. But that&#8217;s exactly the one point that I cannot see in your article. Ok, now that you mentioned it I can see the part where you apparently meant to tell about it.</p>

	<p>As your conclusions go &#8211; most developers (especially the kind that writes plugins to popular software) are simply ignorant about <span class="caps">CSRF</span>, and that&#8217;s the main issue. Most of the time you can change just about any configuration option via <span class="caps">CSRF</span>, and the result won&#8217;t be pretty. Not really an OpenID issue <span class="caps">IMO</span>.</p>
