	<p>Wladimir, no offense but it seems that you don not understand the essence of the attack. Let me put it in bullet points:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>1.</strong> Wordpress users are authorized by usernames and passwords<br />
<strong>2.</strong> OpenID plugin provides easy login via <span class="caps">URL</span><br />
<strong>3.</strong> Users have the option to choose to login either through (username and password) or (<span class="caps">URL</span> via OpenID)<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Users can have as many URLs associated with their account as possible<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Example user like Joghn can have 3 URLs associated with his account, i.e. john.example.com, acme.com/john, google.com/john.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> The form that is responsible for associating users with URLs is vulnerable to <span class="caps">CSRF</span><br />
<strong>7.</strong> Attackers can add a new <span class="caps">URL</span> for John: evil.com/hacker<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Now attackers can login as John by using <span class="caps">URL</span> evil.com/hacker<br />
<strong>9.</strong> CSRFable form is generated by library not by plugin<br />
<strong>10.</strong> Other systems that use this library may also be vulnerable to the same CSRF</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This is the reason why the post have the word <span class="caps">HIJACKIGN</span> in the title. Because the developers are not completely aware of what OpenID is, simple mistakes like this one can lead to big problems.</p>
