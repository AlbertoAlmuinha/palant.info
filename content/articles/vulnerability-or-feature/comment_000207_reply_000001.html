<p>Nothing new here. I already understood what your article is about, you can cut it down to one sentence: &#8220;Registration usually has captcha or similar protection mechanism, authentication via OpenID has similar effect but usually no such protection.&#8221; Which has absolutely nothing to do with <span class="caps">CSRF</span> (you are not forging a request, you are misusing a valid request). Neither does it have anything to do with hijacking &#8211; you are not hijacking any existing accounts, you are creating a new one (which is yours and yours only). And it isn&#8217;t really a library issue &#8211; it is just that services accepting OpenID have to use the same standard for it as for registration (e.g. requiring a captcha to be filled out first time a particular OpenID <span class="caps">URL</span> is used or treating OpenID users like unregistered users). It might be that this hasn&#8217;t been communicated well enough, but you did a very poor job bringing attention to this issue.</p>

	<p>Sorry, but seeing a comment here that only repeats all the same points in the same unintelligible way I only get the impression that you have trouble singling out the important facts.</p>
