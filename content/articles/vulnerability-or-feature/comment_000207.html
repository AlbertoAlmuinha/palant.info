	<p>Wladimir, I am surprised that you still don&#8217;t understand the point of the article even after reading the comments where I personally responded to everyone who has doubts about it. Let&#8217;s get back to the key sentences from the post:</p>

	<p><strong>quote 1</strong></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>When it comes to OpenID, it seams that developers forget about <span class="caps">CSRF</span>, or they just donâ€™t want to simply deal with it, mainly because OpenID is not straightforward type of technology.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><strong>quote 2</strong></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Instead of showing you examples with real, live systems, rather unethical as you may guess, I would like to show you an example of an account hijack technique which is currently present inside one of the few Wordpress OpenID plugins.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><strong>quote 3</strong></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Once the attacker supplies a <span class="caps">URL</span> for the openid_url field, the page will redirect to the OpenID provider specified by that <span class="caps">URL</span>, authenticate and return back to the original position. Given the fact, that the OpenID provider is controlled by the attacker, btw. everyone can host their own OpenID provider, the attack is very trivial to pull. Once this <span class="caps">URL</span> is stored within the plugin database, the attacker will be able to authenticate with the attacked blog without any sort of authorization whatsoever.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Is it still unclear what is the article all about? And if not, do you mind updating your post to outline that?</p>
