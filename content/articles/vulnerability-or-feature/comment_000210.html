	<p>Well, I think that it is a matter of convenience. I personally feel that OpenID is the best thing since sliced bread that has happened to the Web. There are advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that as a responsible user, I can make everything possible to ensure that the integrity of my identity stays intact and secure (think about it, I can now login via my own server with as many factor authentication I want, <span class="caps">RSA</span> tokens? why not?). The disadvantages are that I may stay logged online longer then usual which will result in raise of <span class="caps">CSRF</span> attacks, exactly what I am outlining in my post. Also, if someone manages to compromise my identity they will have access to any resource my online persona has.</p>
