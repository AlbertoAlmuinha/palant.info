	<p>I disregard and ignore people that use long complex ways to say nothing &#8211; just empty words, it&#8217;s noting else but wasted time to write and read. Such streched materials, let use many words to say nothing new, are really big annoyance.</p>

	<p>I greet and appreciate people who say things directly, simply and shortly.</p>
