	<p>doSomething (or the other functions) might be Components.classes[&#8221;&#8220;].createInstance().doSomething();<br />
or a code block<br />
or a function so often used that the additional processing time the replaced function needs for something that minimal is not excusable (especially if multiple extensions do that).</p>

	<p><cite>About maxVersion: extensions are typically compatible with 3.0.*, so this wonâ€™t catch security fixes that happen in minor releases.</cite><br />
Claiming to know the future &#8216;is bound to end badly&#8217;, so that would be the fault of the author actually. Also Mozilla security updates have changed something in a breaking way far too often anyway <span class="caps">IMHO</span> (the latest one I know of was <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=442333#c29" rel="nofollow">bug 442333</a> ).</p>

	<p><cite>patching bugs this way is a really bad idea. File a bug in Bugzilla, provide a patch.</cite><br />
Might already be filed or even be fixed for the next major version, one could use the same code.<br />
Some bugs might take months to actually be patched (even with patches) especially if only external code fails due to it.</p>

	<p><cite>If it is really an obvious bug and safe to fix that fix will be distributed with a minor release.</cite><br />
Which might be a month away assuming it actually will be included within the next minor release, backporting it properly wouldn&#8217;t harm.</p>

	<p><cite>[&#8230;] breaking browser functionality</cite><br />
If the intention of the extension was change what happens normally in the given situation then it likely wanted to break the default functionality.</p>
