<p>Hi Wladimir,</p>
<p>You have a great blog! I'm a long time user of LastPass and wanted to switch to a different manager that's app based as I switch from browser way too often and wanted a solution that was centrally managed from an app. I.e. you login to the app and you're logged in to all the different browser extensions regardless of the browser window. </p>
<p>I did extensive research and did like Remembear the most but I also wanted to make sure their security was good too. I ended up here after googling for Remembear security and couldn't find much else. </p>
<p>While I'm glad all the issues that you reported were fixed I was disappointed that a) there was no security contact easily available and b) all the issues that you reported seemed pretty much as growing pains for a pwd manager that might not be ready for prime time. What were your thoughts in general from their response?</p>
<p>Also, do you have any comments on their security model?
