	<p>I find it astounding that for so long browser vendors seemingly gave zero consideration to the scalability of tabbed browsing. Now it&#8217;s as if everyone&#8217;s giving up on tabbed browsing altogether. Why shouldn&#8217;t a website keep updating itself in the background? All these web evangelists keep rabbiting on about the web &#8211; generally compared to native apps on mobile and/or plugins &#8211; and keep building all these real-time and &#8216;one-page&#8217;-supporting protocols such as WebRTC, <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, WebSockets and so forth, yet now they&#8217;re all complaining when web developers use them! Hypocrisy!!!</p>

	<p>A web developer is not immoral if they run code that will update their site so that it is current immediately upon the user clicking back to it.</p>

	<p>I suggest that the evangelists may finally have pushed the boundaries too far. Why was your average Flash site a performance hog? Perhaps because Flash allowed developers to do a lot of what HTML5 is trying to mimic? Therefore doesn&#8217;t a simplistic analysis suggest that getting rid of Flash solves the proprietary issues with it, but adding Flash&#8217;s functionality to HTML5 would just add the performance degradation as well? That appears to be what is happening. From complaining about background loading to converting tabs to delay-load (making them glorified bookmarks), despite all the hype about the JS engine race and delivery of HTML5 features, browsers are simply hitting a very hard performance road block.</p>

	<p>Has anyone stopped to think that now we see much less Flash sites but that plugin we&#8217;ve been blaming for all sorts of evils is slowly disappearing yet performance degradation in web browsers still exists.</p>
