	<p>Taras recently <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/tglek/2012/04/18/web-2-0-a-collection-of-settimeouts/">blogged</a> on how websites manage to ruin Firefox performance by continuing to do something even though their tab is no longer active&nbsp;&mdash; they keep updating the view that you cannot see. He wondered whether it would be possible to suspend these tabs from an extension. I looked into this and there is a way to suspend all timeouts for a tab&nbsp;&mdash; something that an extension could use. Getting the details right wasn&#8217;t quite trivial but I think that my extension gets it right now: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/suspend-background-tabs/">Suspend background tabs</a>. Enjoy!</p>

	<p>This doesn&#8217;t completely disable all activity in the background tabs of course. Network requests will continue, videos will also keep playing. So I might implement some improvements in future. However, please have understanding that this is a very low priority side-project for me. So it&#8217;s best if you bring your code. The current code is <a href="https://hg.adblockplus.org/suspendbackgroundtabs/">here</a>.</p>
