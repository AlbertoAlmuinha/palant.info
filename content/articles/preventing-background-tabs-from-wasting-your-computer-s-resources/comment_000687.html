<p>I&#8217;m of two minds about this extension. OT1H it sounds like a nice way to avoid, let&#8217;s say, Facebook and Gmail, or maybe forever-animated <span class="caps">GIF</span>s, grabbing <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles to update tabs in which I&#8217;m not interested at the moment; <span class="caps">OTOH</span> won&#8217;t it prevent my multitab homepage from loading immediately at startup, without waiting for me to look at each and every tab?</p>
