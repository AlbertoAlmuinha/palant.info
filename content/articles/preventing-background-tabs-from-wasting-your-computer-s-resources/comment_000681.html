	<p>just discovered another bug to report that might be fixed by the previous suggestion (5 second grace period for new tabs): </p>

	<p>i have a &#8220;flashblock&#8221; extension that enables click-to-play for flash. if i open a youtube video in the background tab (middleclick) it starts playing, probably because the javascript from the flashblock extension didn&#8217;t run..</p>

	<p>alternatively, maybe you can enable javascript from addons if there is a method to distinguish them from page javascript..</p>
