<p>Have been using this and it&#8217;s really helpful in managing the expense of the browser on the <span class="caps">CPU</span>. One thing I will save though is that if it could wait till any background activity has stopped before suspending it, that&#8217;d be good. i.e. clicking post on a form.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, any chance of a blog post detailing your progress regarding making <span class="caps">ABP</span> restartless?</p>
