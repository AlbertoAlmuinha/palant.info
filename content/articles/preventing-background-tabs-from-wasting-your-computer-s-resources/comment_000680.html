	<p>nice extension, mostly works well. one problem and a possible solution:</p>

	<p>some sites don&#8217;t open well in background tabs. for example, try to middle-click open this business week page in the background, it breaks: </p>

	<p>http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-10/on-diasporas-social-network-you-own-your-data</p>

	<p>(it breaks only the first time, if you don&#8217;t have the site cached i guess. if it doesn&#8217;t happen, try a clean profile)</p>

	<p>the possible solution might be to give every new tab a &#8220;grace period&#8221; for say 5 seconds where you don&#8217;t block events. after that, if they don&#8217;t load, it&#8217;s theirs fault.. ;)</p>
