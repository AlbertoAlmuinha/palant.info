<p>@tom jones: Have you tried the built-in Flash blocking in NoScript?</p>

	<p>I remember encountering incompatibilities between FlashBlock and NoScript because FlashBlock hooked its &#8220;click to play&#8221; code up as part of the page rather than part of the browser and it&#8217;d be interesting to see if this interferes with NoScript&#8217;s flash blocking, given that it&#8217;s supposed to be not only immune to that problem but also secure protection against 0-day Flash exploits.</p>

	<p>If it does work, then it IS possible to turn off the Javascript whitelisting and just use NoScript&#8217;s other features (stuff like click-to-play for everything from Silverlight to WebGL, blocking for attempts to use your browser to attack your router&#8217;s internal WebUI, etc.)</p>
