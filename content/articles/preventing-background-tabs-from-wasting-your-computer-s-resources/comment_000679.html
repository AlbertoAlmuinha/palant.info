<p>Sites such as turbobit.net makes the user wait for a 60 second countdown before user can download a file. In such a scenario it would improve productivity if the user can browse other tabs while backgroundtab resumes countdown.<br />
I think whitelisting is a more user convenient approach than pinning tabs.</p>
