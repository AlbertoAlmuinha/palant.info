	<p>Please bear with me for the loads of incoming questions, but I would be very much interested in the details of this extension, on what exactly it now suspends/throttles/whatnotâ€¦</p>

	<p>So what activity is now disabled? I guess calls by setTimeout/setInterval are suspended (which were already throttled in newer Firefox versions, see bug 379535)? Meta-refresh probably too (like NoScript does per-default for untrusted sites)? Stuff that depends on the Firefox core is probably not touched, like animated images (bug 588975), incremental layout (bug 341046), prioritisation of network requests (would no NO_DELAY for background tabs make sense?), suspension of the text blinking timer in background tabs (bug 526715), or some of the other stuff that blocks bug 595574?<br />
With videos you mean plugin-based and/or HTML5?<br />
How is it determined that a background tab is a background tab? Whether it is an &#8220;active&#8221; tab? What about the topmost tab in a minimized window?</p>
