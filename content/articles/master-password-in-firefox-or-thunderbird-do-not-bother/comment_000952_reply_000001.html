<p>You seem to be mistaking passphrase length for password strength. Even if your passphrase is 320 bit long, it typically won&#8217;t have that much entropy &#8211; usually in the area of 40 bits or slightly more than that. A truly random password would be safe even in this scenario but people cannot remember those. Either way, they shouldn&#8217;t have to &#8211; there are trivial measures that can be taken to protect against bruteforcing.</p>
