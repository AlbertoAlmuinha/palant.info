<p>Just to make it more clear: I have seen Mozilla kill too many promising projects, so I&#8217;ll only believe it when I see it happen. Nobody knows at this point whether Lockbox will ever get a chance to solve any issues or when that might happen. In the meantime, there is nothing wrong with spending an hour to fix what we have right now.</p>
