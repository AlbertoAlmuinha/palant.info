<p>Obviously, I use my PfP extension myself &#8211; that works for Firefox and can generate a long master password for Thunderbird. I&#8217;d say that any master password complex enough to keep that graphics card busy for at least a year would be sufficiently secure. This means that 5.4⋅10¹⁷ possible combinations (roughly 59 bits) is your lower bound. The default password complexity for PfP allows for 4.2⋅10³⁰ combinations (more than 100 bits), so that&#8217;s actually way more than necessary here.</p>

<p>Not everybody wants to use my hobby project of course. As far as other password managers go, 1Password is currently the only one I can recommend security-wise.</p>
