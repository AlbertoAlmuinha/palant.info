<p>The Firefox password manager indeed is not as strong as it would be expected nowadays (it also is much much older than any of the techniques you describe). This is why Mozilla is working on the Lockbox extension for Firefox, a new password manager with adequate security and that allows secure syncing via Firefox Sync (which in general guarantees that your data can only be decrypted on your machine(s)). See also https://mozilla-lockbox.github.io/lockbox-extension/ if you want to take a look and contribute! :)</p>
