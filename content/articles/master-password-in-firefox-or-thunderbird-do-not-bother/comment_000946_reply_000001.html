<p>As I mentioned in bug 524403, I don&#8217;t think that chasing yet another great rewrite will solve any issues. I did have a look a while ago already, but Lockbox has a huge disadvantage: it relies on Firefox Accounts. Should it ever replace the password manager in Firefox, I don&#8217;t see its adoption to be too high if that doesn&#8217;t change. And if the dependency on FxA is dropped, then it will likely again boil down to securing <span class="caps">NSS</span>. Which should really be a no-brainer.</p>
