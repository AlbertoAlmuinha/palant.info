<p>Of course, switching from <span class="caps">SHA</span>-1 to <span class="caps">SHA</span>-256 isn&#8217;t going to improve security in a significant way. Passwords have to be hashed with a slow hashing function, at the very least PBKDF2 with an appropriate number of rounds.</p>

<p>I know that Chrome uses <span class="caps">NSS</span>, but <span class="caps">AFAIK</span> not for storing passwords. In fact, Chrome generally doesn&#8217;t do master passwords, stating that once your OS account has been breached you already lost. This argument makes sense when you are thinking in terms of security boundaries, yet master passwords still offer value &#8211; there aren&#8217;t too many people who will perform the clearly illegal action of installing a keylogger on your machine, yet way more won&#8217;t mind extracting data from it if they find it unlocked. Either way, while I didn&#8217;t look into it closely, I assume that Chrome uses the same mechanism for protecting passwords that they use for cookies. At least on Windows they use an encryption mechanism provided by the OS to encrypt that data. This encryption key is tied to your user account and only available when you are logged in. Whether that&#8217;s worse or better than what Firefox provides you with is a matter of discussion.</p>

<p>Mind you, Chrome is far from perfect of course. See for example my next blog post: <a href="https://palant.de/2018/03/13/can-chrome-sync-or-firefox-sync-be-trusted-with-sensitive-data" rel="nofollow">https://palant.de/2018/03/13/can-chrome-sync-or-firefox-sync-be-trusted-with-sensitive-data</a></p>
