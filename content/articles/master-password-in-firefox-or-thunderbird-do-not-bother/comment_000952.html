<p>Why are we surprised that the Firefox master password system is susceptible to decryption when you use a weak master password? </p>

<p>You said “Sure, you could choose a stronger password. But finding a considerably stronger password that you can still remember will be awfully hard.” I disagree. A longer password &#8211; especially a passphrase, with punctuation and all &#8211; is not that hard to remember. I don&#8217;t think you focused nearly enough on the security difference here. How secure is a 240 bit passphrase in Firefox&#8217;s system, for comparison? What about 320 bits? I don&#8217;t use Firefox anymore, but when I did, my master password was almost 40 characters long. If such a password is insufficient, then to me that sounds like a bigger deal than it not securing passwords that are shorter than recommended, anyway.</p>
