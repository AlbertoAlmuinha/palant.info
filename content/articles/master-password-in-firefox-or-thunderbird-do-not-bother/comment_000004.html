<p>If you can crack a SHA1 password with 40 bit under a minute (based on the 8.5 billion SHA1/sec.<br />
However based on the https://gist.github.com/epixoip/a83d38f412b4737e99bbef804a270c40 this means you can also crack <span class="caps">SHA</span>-256 in under 3 minutes. I mean brute force is brute force.<br />
Did you know that Chrome also uses <span class="caps">NSS</span> (on linux) probably with the same master password complexity.</p>
