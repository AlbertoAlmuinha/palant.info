	<p>A <a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2012/06/06/824-deleted-my-linkedin-account">bunch</a> <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2012/06/leaving-linkedin.html">of</a> <a href="http://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/2012/06/i-have-just-closed-my-linkedin-account-did-you/">posts</a> on Planet Mozilla reminded me that there is still one social network that I am a member of. So it was time to reconsider whether having a LinkedIn account was worth it.</p>

	<p>Pros:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>I get to play the same &#8220;I have <em>sooooo</em> many contacts&#8221; game as everybody else.</li>
		<li>I have a place to remind me of people who I worked with 10 years ago but who weren&#8217;t interesting enough to remember.</li>
		<li>If I need to point somebody to my past experience I can simply give them a link (not that I&#8217;ve ever done that).</li>
		<li>My friends get informed about my career advancements without having to talk to me.</li>
		<li>There is a chance that I will get a great job offer because somebody sees my LinkedIn profile and is impressed (unfortunately, the chance to get contacted by a head hunter who simply contacts everybody is significantly higher).</li>
		<li>LinkedIn shows somewhat more respect for my privacy than Facebook and most other social networks.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Cons:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>My profile page keeps nagging me about my profile being &#8220;incomplete&#8221;. No, that page already has too much of my information and I&#8217;m not feeding it more.</li>
		<li>I regularly get invitations to connect to some people who I don&#8217;t know. I used to answer, then I gave up and started ignoring them. But to ignore I have to log in and click &#8220;Ignore&#8221;, otherwise LinkedIn will continue sending me reminders. So I changed the settings to allow requests only from people knowing my email address. With my email address not exactly hard to find some are still coming through however.</li>
		<li>LinkedIn just confirmed <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/LinkedIn-passwords-in-circulation-Update-1612022.html">leaking at least 6.5 million user passwords</a>. And they seriously <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/features/Comment-LinkedIn-and-its-password-problems-1612877.html">used unsalted hashes</a>. Now I use a unique password for each site but having my friends spammed through my LinkedIn account still wouldn&#8217;t be great.</li>
		<li>Did I really say that they respect my privacy? At least <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/LinkedIn-app-uploads-complete-calendar-entries-1612496.html">their mobile app doesn&#8217;t</a> and the official explanation doesn&#8217;t sound too plausible.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Having considered all this I decided to close my LinkedIn account. Has been fun eight years ago when I opened it, not any more. If you need to get in touch with me&nbsp;&mdash; there are still plenty of ways.</p>
