<p>For reference, <span class="caps">AMO</span> statistics show that the vast majority of users updated to version 1.6.5 already. The update speed is quite consistent with back when version 1.5.4 was being phased out. Most people who didn&#8217;t update yet are on 1.6.3 rather than 1.6.4, so it doesn&#8217;t look like too many people are concerned by that update prompt.</p>
