<p>I would not recommend you to go back to a &#8220;https://*&#8221; permission prompt. Some time ago I received a notification from Firefox about your plugin now wanting access to all websites and refused to update it. While it may make a few things easier for you, you&#8217;re misleading your users most of whom are privacy conscious.</p>
