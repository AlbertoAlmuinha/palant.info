<p><a href="http://hackademix.net/2009/01/15/7-f-acts/">Giorgio</a> knew very well of course that I was only waiting for a chance to tag him, so he tagged me first. Argh&#8230; Whatever, here are the rules:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Link to your original tagger(s) and list these rules in your post.</li>
		<li>Share seven facts about yourself in the post.</li>
		<li>Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.</li>
		<li>Let them know they’ve been tagged.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>And here are seven things about me you probably don&#8217;t know:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>I lived the first twelve years of my life in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u">Chişinău</a> (or rather Кишинев as it was called back then). No, not Russia but still <span class="caps">USSR</span>&nbsp;&mdash; close enough. No, I don&#8217;t speak Moldovan language, four years of Moldovan classes at school certainly weren&#8217;t enough to leave a trace in my memory (more about this below).</li>
		<li>I discovered programming when I was eleven and immediately got very enthusiastic about it. My first programming language was Basic (not very surprising) but shortly after that I learned FoxPro. No, not Visual FoxPro&nbsp;&mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro_2">FoxPro 2</a>. My parents got so concerned that I spend too much time at the computer that they added a boot password. Of course they had no chance, it didn&#8217;t take me long to hack it.</li>
		<li>I experienced all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany">secondary school types in Germany</a> first-hand, starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptschule">Hauptschule</a> (where I got pretty decent grades despite not knowing the language at all), spending several years at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realschule">Realschule</a> and finishing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)">Gymnasium</a>. That&#8217;s what happens when you come to a country and nobody cares to explain you that there are three different school types in this country and the one you went to before is equivalent to Gymnasium. I only got that important piece of knowledge when our class was brought to a job information center and I was told that I cannot become a programmer after finishing Hauptschule.</li>
		<li>I wrote a simple game for the <a href="http://www.taswegian.com/MOSCOW/mk-61.html">Электроника МК-61</a> calculator. For those not knowing what I am talking about, that was a very advanced piece of technology, with memory enough for 105 (!) instructions. The one I got had an additional quirk: it would overheat and behave erratically after some 20 minutes, so you had to learn typing in your 105 instructions very fast. Of course my parents didn&#8217;t buy this calculator for me (it was worth 1/2 of what you would usually earn a month) but I &#8220;inherited&#8221; it from my brother once he didn&#8217;t need it any more.</li>
		<li>I lived in Norway for three years and yet I still don&#8217;t speak Norwegian. I can understand Norwegian texts and I might be able to understand a Norwegian talking to me&nbsp;&mdash; if he does me a favor and speaks slowly (something Norwegians almost never do). I know that this is lame but my brain is surprisingly incapable of absorbing human languages, especially in spoken form. I only speak three languages because I had no other choice. And in Norway everybody can speak English so why should anyone learn their language?</li>
		<li>Once upon a time I was co-administrator of a community site called Vampires.de (yes, it is long gone). How did I end up there? I have no idea but a friend of mine liked hanging out there, I helped out with a few issues and then it already happened. So I learned Perl by hacking their YaBB forum (those of you familiar with the YaBB forum know that this is a very bad way of learning Perl) and even wrote a web-based chat for that site.</li>
		<li>This chat (named &#8220;GT-chat&#8221;) became my first contribution to the world-wide internet community. It wasn&#8217;t great but apparently most other chats were even worse. After some time I became disgusted by the infantile community this project attracted and abandoned it&nbsp;&mdash; only to discover that my loyal followers kept the project alive and even <a href="http://www.gt-chat.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;site=main">ripped off the horrible design and the awkward English translation of my old site</a>.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Now finally my seven victims:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/ndeakin/">Neil Deakin</a>, because I still don&#8217;t understand how one man could have built up such a comprehensive source of information about the Mozilla platform.</li>
		<li><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre">Robert Sayre</a>,  because he is always so kind&nbsp;&mdash; what secrets is he hiding?</li>
		<li><a href="http://andreaswuest.blogspot.com/">Andreas Wuest</a>, because he should finally start to blog.</li>
		<li><a href="http://fredericiana.com/">Frederic Wenzel</a>, because Germans should get some fun too.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.melez.com/mykzilla/">Myk Melez</a>, just to learn where all those ideas come from.</li>
		<li><a href="http://icouldntfindanypaper.blogspot.com/">Melissa Shapiro</a>, how does this PR thing work anyway?</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/">Jan Odvarko</a>, for no real reason.</li>
