<p>This blog article wasn’t written by me. But if you ask my opinion: yes, KeePass is generally solid technology if you stay clear of legacy databases. Presumably, same is true for KeeWeb even though I’d strongly recommend a downloaded client rather than the online web application (for the same reasons I discourage the PfP web client). The main issue with these applications is usability however. By itself, they are rather inconvenient. To make filling in passwords more convenient, a range of third-party solutions exist – with questionable security.</p>
