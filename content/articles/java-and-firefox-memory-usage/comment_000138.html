	<p>It&#8217;s the same with all the applications! with LimeWire Pro my the downloads were so (so so so so&#8230; ouch) slow, I saw this freaking tip of the day (whatever it called) and it says that LimeWire will work faster and will be more stable with the latest java runtime environment&#8230; true true the app itself works now faster and so are the search speed and my <span class="caps">DOWNLOAD</span> speed (I think 5 times faster, if not more!!)</p>
