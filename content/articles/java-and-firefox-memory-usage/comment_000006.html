	<p>Ah&#8230; Java&#8230;<br />
Developers are unanimous: it&#8217;s a great programming language, easier to learn, to use, object-oriented programming is wonderful, etc.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, users are unanimous too: each time a software launches Java Virtual Machine, it&#8217;s a nightmare&#8230;<br />
Personally, each time a site uses java, I know I&#8217;ll have to close browser <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p>

	<p>Don&#8217;t know who is the most responsible, Sun or Mozilla&#8230; or nobody.</p>
