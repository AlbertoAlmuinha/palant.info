Foxit Reader is better than Acrobat Reader.<br />
<a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php" rel="nofollow" >http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php</a><br />
And also, i think QuickTime Alternative<br />
<a href="http://www.codecguide.com/about_qt.htm" rel="nofollow" >http://www.codecguide.com/about_qt.htm</a> *<br />
is much better than Official QuickTime<br />
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download" rel="nofollow" >http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download</a></p>

	<p>* that site also has Real Alternative, but i have not used that or Official one much, i don&#8217;t need it.</p>

	<p>Only plugins i have are QuickTime (Alternative) and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash" rel="nofollow" >Flash</a> , that&#8217;s it.<br />
(Foxit Reader is not plugin, is external program that opens .pdf files.)<br />
And yes, i have disabled Windows Media Player Plug-in,<br />
i did go to <b>about:config</b> and i did put very high number here:<br />
<b>plugin.scan.WindowsMediaPlayer</b>. So now Firefox does not use it.<br />
I did not have problems with that plugin, but now some sites just load little bit faster, and some sites have &#8220;download this video&#8221; -button, so i don&#8217;t miss much.</p>
