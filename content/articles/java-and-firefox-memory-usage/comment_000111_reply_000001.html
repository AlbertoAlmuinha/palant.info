<p>It is hardly used anywhere on the web &#8211; and that&#8217;s exactly the reason why I didn&#8217;t see much point in upgrading. I still use <span class="caps">JDK</span> 1.5 for programming and I don&#8217;t need a runtime that is newer for that either. Actually, no homebanking application I used required Java, all of them are happy with <span class="caps">SSL</span> + JavaScript. The only web page with Java that I sometimes use is map24.com but I usually prefer Google Maps.</p>
