	<p>&#8220;Java is a great language â€“ just not for the web.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Amen, my friend. I cringe at the clicking of my hard drive after the whole page has loaded just knowing that the &#8216;coffee cup&#8217; is going to appear in my tray. God help should you hit the &#8216;back&#8217; button right in the middle of one of those &#8216;god for saken&#8217; an applet loads in Firefox &#8230;. I think that that mistake has been my only cause of crashes ever with Fx.</p>

	<p>There are so many more &#8216;web friendly&#8217; type scripts to replace java over the years. I really don&#8217;t know why anyone uses that on the web anymore :-(</p>
