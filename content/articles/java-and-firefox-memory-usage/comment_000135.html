	<p>AH! I just remembered why I initiatly downloaded this Java crap in the 1st place: LIMEWIRE!!!!!</p>

	<p>Everybody here who has for one reason or another forgotten why they installed Java and deduced it to a site that you probably really wanted to visit and view content on&#8230; might have to see if you have Limewire installed.</p>

	<p>I know millions alone have Java installed for this very reason alone as the application will not run without it.</p>

	<p>I wonder when Limewire flops, so will Java downloads? Bahahahahaa.</p>
