<p>&#8220;# out of #&#8221; is actually unproblematic, it isn&#8217;t a full sentence. But &#8220;# filter subscription(s) and # custom filter(s) in use&#8221; is pretty ugly when translated and I am not very happy about that. As I said, &#8220;if possible&#8221; &#8211; in this particular case I couldn&#8217;t see another solution that would still be compact.</p>
