	<p>Yeah, I know about that bug &#8211; and I&#8217;m dreading the day the change actually lands.</p>

	<p>I agree with the idea in principle, but open web technologies aren&#8217;t mature enough to easily replace what we do with remote <span class="caps">XUL</span> right now. Things are moving in the right direction, but we&#8217;re not there yet. Our software is specifically designed for intranet use (like most remote <span class="caps">XUL</span> apps, I suspect) where the use of open formats is less of a concern than on the web at large. </p>

	<p>I just hope that bug lands far enough in the future for us to have replaced most of our remote <span class="caps">XUL</span> widgets with XBL2 and <span class="caps">HTML</span>. We&#8217;ll still have to roll our own alternatives to overlays and templates though, as I don&#8217;t see any open equivalent of those coming anytime soon.</p>
