	<p>Very interesting blogpost, I am glad to see sometimes one real developer has such insight about localization problems and take them seriously into account, probably because he hits issues unfortunately.<br />
I also have hopes and scepticism about L20n project, which is not surfacing as quickly as expected (?).</p>

	<p>I agree with most recommendations in the Getting good localizations ยง except : </p>

	<p>* Though not really satisfying as a solution, I don&#8217;t think various placeholders in a string may annoy experienced translators.</p>

	<p>As for the user downloading any other language than the app useragent locale, this feature is available in Songbird but requires restart.</p>

	<p>About BabelZilla : sure there may be bugs and various annoyances, but it is a bit an overstatement to describe extension translation as painful :D.<br />
Serious developers are welcome to help and make our process better.<br />
As for xulrunners, considering the locale structure is just as classical as in an extension, babelzilla is just as usable, or as problematic if you want :P<br />
(translating langpacks for songbird, komodo, spicebird proved not to be such a big challenge)</p>
