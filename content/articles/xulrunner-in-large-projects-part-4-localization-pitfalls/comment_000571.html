	<p>Hi Wladimir, nice post.</p>

	<p>A few comments: You&#8217;re using &#8220;Mozilla does&#8230;&#8221; quite generously. l10n-checks for example seem to be a project by Adrian Kalla, probably related to the l10n checks that <span class="caps">AMO</span> does. Sadly, I don&#8217;t know their details either. We&#8217;re not using verbatim for app l10n, just for plain PO web content/we apps. narro is in use by localizers for the apps, but community-maintained.</p>

	<p>I would think that you&#8217;re overestimating the issues around getting xulrunner langpacks, it depends mostly on whether your app supports add-ons. If it does, you can use langpacks rather nicely, and creating them for your apps shouldn&#8217;t be that hard to reverse engineer from fx these days. Not trivial or shrink-wrapped, granted, but as said in other posts of yours, xulrunner ain&#8217;t that anyway ;-). Executive summary, your own files plus libs-ab-CD in toolkit/locales, plus some decent packaging in a jar.</p>

	<p>I would also like to stress that we&#8217;ll likely continue to put quite a bit of burden on the build process for l10n data, <span class="caps">DTD</span>/properties or l20n alike. The tests to be run are neither simple, nor is the amount of data involved small, so anything that can be statically checked at build time should be. If nothing else than for performance reasons.</p>

	<p>I have another patch on hold that&#8217;ll make the compare-locales checks stronger still, and make l10n-merge fix found errors (by replacing them with en-US, plurals-badness withstanding). I need to pick that up again.</p>

	<p>Another interesting aspect is that Adrian is working on a project to run l10n-focused mozmill tests, in particular we have code in stock that will look for cropped text and create screenshots of those problems. If your xulrunner app works with mozmill, you might be able to re-use some of that.</p>
