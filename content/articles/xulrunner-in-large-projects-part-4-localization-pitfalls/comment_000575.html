<p>The situation is even worse for remote <span class="caps">XUL</span> apps: bug #22942 means that <span class="caps">DTD</span>s have to be injected into the page directly if you use them, and I wasn&#8217;t able to get string bundles to work for remote <span class="caps">XUL</span>.</p>

	<p>Currently we inject our <span class="caps">DTD</span>, and use a separate JS function to download and parse the <span class="caps">DTD</span> separately if we need to use any strings within our JS code.</p>

	<p>Injecting our monolithic <span class="caps">DTD</span> is too heavy &#8211; our <span class="caps">DTD</span> content is bigger than the whole of the rest of some apps. If #22942 were to get fixed then this would be less of an issue, as the <span class="caps">DTD</span> would usually be cached, but instead we&#8217;re having to look at re-writing our server-side code to only inject the entities needed in a particular app.</p>
