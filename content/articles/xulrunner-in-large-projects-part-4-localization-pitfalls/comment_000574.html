	<p>Songbird does indeed do the automatic-download thing; it&#8217;s not perfect, though, since it makes offline installs show up in en-US only.  I think one of our hardware partners (i.e. who actually ship media to end users) include a few key languages in their installer since the size pressure is smaller there.  If we had more time for this stuff, I&#8217;d have liked to ship locale-specific installers as well; alas&#8230;</p>

	<p>I believe we actually grab the Firefox release locale xpis and slip it into the Songbird locale extension (with a rewritten manifest of course).</p>

	<p>Our actual setup for l10n is&#8230; well, almost workable, but not quite perfect.  Localizers want things like actual files to check in/out (so their existing tools can work with them better, and the ability to work offline, etc.), and the locale packaging can still have hiccups.  Sadly yet another bit that needs more time. :(</p>

	<p>Sadly, I suspect l20n won&#8217;t be able to make the Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4) train&#8230; The version switch ended up being rather sudden and there isn&#8217;t enough time to switch the app over, even if the engine itself was completed in time.</p>
