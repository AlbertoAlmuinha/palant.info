<p>Actually, there is a bug on disabling remote <span class="caps">XUL</span> altogether for security reasons. Things were going that way, supporting remote <span class="caps">XUL</span> requires tons of effort and Mozilla has no reason to invest into it. Quite the opposite &#8211; pushing a proprietary technology to the web goes against Mozilla&#8217;s goals.</p>
