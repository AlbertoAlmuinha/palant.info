	<p>Once again, nice article&#8230;<br />
I can&#8217;t wait anymore for “*$script,third-party” ! :P</p>

	<p>Else, I&#8217;m a bit off topic&#8230; it seems you&#8217;re an expert in security, but if you want to find, you will always find a way to break security. For example spywares can easily add a new extension if they want.</p>

	<p>So it&#8217;s a good thing to deal with security, but you can&#8217;t fight against users who install a lot of thing&#8230;</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t like Noscript because I consider it ruins web pages. But saying Noscript is not secured because of a little detail (an attack against noscript users: 0.01% web-users) is a bit &#8220;far-fetched&#8221;.</p>

	<p>But I&#8217;ve understood your ideas, what you mean. ;)</p>
