<p>He, how are you?<br />
Just wanted to mention, I tried the 3rd party line in adblock Plus and deactivated NoScript, and it works, so far at least :).<br />
Since an add on is a potential risk, and only FF uses them what would be your alternative?<br />
Block JS globally and manually allow each, or is that too time consuming?<br />
Or use Opera with urlfilter.ini?</p>

	<p>PS: I came here following a link from Lorenzo Celsi&#8217;s Blog, he is quite furious about the author of Noscript and bashing everybody who defends using it :D.</p>
