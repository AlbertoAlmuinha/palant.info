<p>We are speaking about an attack exploiting Firefox vulnerabilities &#8211; that&#8217;s what NoScript is supposed to protect against. And if somebody is launching this attack, NoScript is certainly more noticeable. Still, so far NoScript has been flying under the radar but this can change. Meaning that while NoScript offers a little protection from attacks that don&#8217;t consider it, relying on NoScript would be foolish.</p>
