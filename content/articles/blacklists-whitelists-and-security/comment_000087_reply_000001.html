<p>Using these scripts hosted on Yahoo would be a very bad choice. You make yourself dependent on Yahoo (what happens with your site if Yahoo goes off-line because of some technical problems?), but more importantly – you trust Yahoo with the security of your site. If Yahoo’s servers are hacked these scripts might suddenly start serving malware. We have seen it before (<a href="http://www.enterprise-security-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=28597" rel="nofollow" >http://www.enterprise-security-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=28597</a>). And I don’t even want to talk about all the data you inadvertently send you Yahoo. Unfortunately I know that many people will use this offer nevertheless.</p>

	<p>The main question is: will the site still be usable if these scripts fail to load? Judging by the examples I suspect that this isn’t the case. That means that you will either whitelist Yahoo’s scripts or look for another site with a more sane webmaster.</p>
