	<p>Wladimir, you forgot to mention that I&#8217;m actively developing <span class="caps">XSS</span> countermeasures.</p>

	<p>I can add that the path I&#8217;m following is very promising, and it will probably take care of most, if not all, the web-based attack vectors (email is another story, of course).</p>

	<p>After our nice conversation I realized my first approach involving outgoing traffic analysis was too much &#8220;Enumerating  Badness&#8221;, far from the spirit of NoScript, so I drastically changed direction.</p>

	<p>I won&#8217;t enter into technical details right now, but I plan to release a preview build in 36-48 hours at most. Your comments will be welcome as always :)</p>
