<p>I didn&#8217;t forget, it just wasn&#8217;t relevant here, and I am still very skeptical of what you are trying to do. You cannot fix the web that easily. <span class="caps">XSS</span> is everywhere and you will only be able to block the most obvious kinds of it (at the cost of usability, as usually). But the sites where it really matters (Google, Yahoo &#38; Co.) already get regular audits and chances are that a successful attack against them will not use anything obvious.</p>
