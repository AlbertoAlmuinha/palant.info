	<p>Wladimir, being skeptic is your right of course, since you did not see the code and I didn&#8217;t disclose the concept yet.</p>

	<p>Let me just clarify that while my solution comes at some usability cost as usual (security x convenience = K), it&#8217;s <i>very</i> bearable and occasional, much more than having JavaScript-only links disabled on not-whitelisted sites like any NoScript user has. </p>

	<p>Moreover, and I know it&#8217;s a bold statement, I&#8217;m quite confident it will block even the less obvious <i>web</i> <i>based</i> <span class="caps">XSS</span>, at least in the scope of the NoScript &#8220;perceived contract&#8221; (i.e. when the &#8220;phase 1 vector&#8221;, the attack initiator, is an unknown web page).</p>
