<p>The thing is that Firefox is pretty good at dealing with the stupid malware authors already. So far I have only heard of malware targeting old and already fixed security issues. That leaves us with &#8220;evil geniuses&#8221; who are capable of finding a serious bug in Firefox but decide to abuse it instead of reporting. And those could easily work around NoScript as an extra bonus.</p>

	<p>Also, as I wrote earlier &#8211; Firefox is a much harder target to hit than Internet Explorer, which is why I don&#8217;t expect significant security threats any time soon (if the developers keep up with their excellent work of course). In this context I don&#8217;t see NoScript reducing anything significantly, but it takes a lot of credit for something that Firefox does out of the box.</p>
