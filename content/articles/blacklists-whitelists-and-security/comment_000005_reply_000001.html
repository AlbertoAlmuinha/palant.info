<p>The third-party flag is supposed to disallow loading from a different <span class="caps">TLD</span> only. So loading scripts from user.smugmug.com on www.smugmug.com will be fine, only loading scripts from user.hackhack.com will be disallowed. Otherwise this flag would most certainly break every major site out there.</p>

	<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t think the rules I mentioned above will ever be added by default. It will be documented that you <strong>can</strong> do this, yet the user will still have to add them himself &#8211; which qualifies him as above average and probably able to deal with most problems.</p>
