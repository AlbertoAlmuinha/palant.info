	<p>I have just been researching it so far, not using it on my own sites, but the Yahoo! User Interface Library (<span class="caps">YUI</span>) set of very useful and powerful scripts is one that may well be broken by rules this tight.  </p>

	<p>For one thing, yahoo is offering to host them, so you can use them but not use your own copies, pointing to theirs instead.</p>

	<p>You <strong>can</strong> of course put the scripts on your own site, but your suggested rule about now loading 3rd party scripts would break any that took advantage of the yahoo hosting.  I’m sure this isn’t the only case of a legitimate use of scripts hosted elsewhere.</p>
