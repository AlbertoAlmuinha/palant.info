<p>yes, I know there are risks to using the scripts from yahoo&#8217;s server, and I&#8217;m not saying that I would make the choice to use them. At this point I would not, for the reasons you mention. (privacy, security, own control over all my site&#8217;s files)</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m just saying that at least one very large and generally well-respected javascript library system <strong>is</strong> offering this kind of thing.  If you read the comments on their blog about this hosting, you&#8217;ll see that there <strong>are</strong> many people who seem to think this is a good thing and seem likely to use it. </p>

	<p>Yes, as a user, you could whitelist them, <strong>if</strong> you are a user who is smart enough to know what is wrong when the site doesn&#8217;t work, and how to whitelist.  (hopefully adblock or your browser would tell you or give clear indication that something was blocked, and would offer a way to get details and to whitelist them if necessary)</p>

	<p>I can also say that I use smugmug.com for photos.  They are using <span class="caps">YUI</span>.  I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;d be using the hosted scripts, but they might.  They also use subdomains for each account, so it&#8217;d be likely that user.smugmug.com might point to scripts on another subdomain&#8230; www.smugmug.com?  Just an example.</p>

	<p>Anyway, whether you think it is risky or not, it seems that this is one example of a legitimate 3rd party hosted script use that may become widespread.  So, your plans for security rules should consider that.</p>
