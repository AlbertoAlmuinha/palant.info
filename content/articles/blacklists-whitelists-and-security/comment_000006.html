	<p>How about inline script annoyances? There are scripts which doesn&#8217;t match “*$script,third-party” rule &#8211; they are inline &#8211; and I can&#8217;t find way to disable them. It would be nice feature to have, in addition to:</p>

	<p>http://www.badsite.net/*$script</p>

	<p>to have f.e. option &#8220;inline&#8221;:</p>

	<p>http://www.badsite.net/*$script,inline</p>

	<p>to eliminate inline scripts. Or to dream even more &#8211; to have parameter based on content:</p>

	<p>Thanks.</p>
