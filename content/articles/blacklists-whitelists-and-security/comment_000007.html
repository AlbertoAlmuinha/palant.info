	<p>You are assuming that all malware distributors are evil geniuses.  They are not.  The chances of a trojan being written that is advanced enough to get past noscript is much smaller than the chance of one that works on the vanilla install of Firefox.  Noscript isn&#8217;t perfect security, but it is a very large reduction of the risk.<br />
Fortunately, up until now there haven&#8217;t been many drive-by download exploits in the wild with unprotected Firefox- but as Firefox becomes more popular, the risk will go up.  And Noscript will always reduce that risk, a lot.</p>

	<p>Someday you may regret that you didn&#8217;t install it.</p>
