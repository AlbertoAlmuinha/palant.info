<p>firefox2/2-0-0-17__4/firefox2.exe<br />
<span class="caps">AVG</span> 8.5 detected Trojan BackDoor Generic12.DCF</p>

	<p>On a seperate note has anyone gotton Safari to work without completely disabling thier firewall?<br />
I can&#8217;t seem to find what ports or app its using to get out.<br />
It works fine on 127.0.0.1 localhost but just can&#8217;t seem to get out to the www even if I reset all my firewall app settings.<br />
(although in hindsight its not a big deal for browser compatability checking on a local dev environment though it does suck for portable browser use)</p>
