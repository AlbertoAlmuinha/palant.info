	<p>Regarding the problem on comment #9. It happened to me too. I managed to restore my spoon browser vitualization.</p>

	<p>This problem came up when I changed the proxy setting on my computer&#8217;s built in Internet Explorer, (IE7)</p>

	<p>I have tried different things to restore spoon plugin (which why I got here) but no luck until I remembered that the problem only occurred after I changed the proxy settings in my Internet Explorer&#8217;s connection settings.</p>

	<p>If you have this problem, try removing any proxy connection on your built in IE, it may also solve your problem.</p>

	<p>First, fire up your built in IE. <br />
Next, click on Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Connections (tab) -&gt; click on <span class="caps">LAN</span> Settings button<br />
Finally, uncheck &#8220;Use proxy server blah blah blah.&#8221;, click &#8220;OK&#8221; and you can now use Spoon Browser Sandbox again.</p>

	<p>Hope it helps!</p>
