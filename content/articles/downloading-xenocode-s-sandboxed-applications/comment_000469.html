	<p>I have discovered Browser Sandbox about 4 weeks ago and I find it really great project. Unfortunately it has been already using the plugin to download the executables.</p>

	<p>First maybe second time too, everything worked fine but later when I tried to run any of the browsers the message saying &#8220;Errors occured while buffering&#8230;&#8221; popped up. I got it working by uninstalling the sandbox manager completely and manually deleting all the xenocode files under Documents And Settings.</p>

	<p>Now this method failed too. No chance to make it working (maybe new version released is the reason).</p>

	<p>Has anybody stored the former standalone executables for further usage and would it be possible to upload them somewhere please? I really need them for web testing.</p>

	<p>The executables are not at this time even available in cache folder. There are only some xlayer files I dont know how to use so I can neither tell a friend to download them for me.</p>

	<p>Thanx for help.</p>
