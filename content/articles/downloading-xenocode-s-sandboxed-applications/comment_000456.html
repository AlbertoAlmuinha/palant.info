	<p>Too bad. This would have been nice to have. While Microsoft are gracious enough to provide free <span class="caps">VHD</span>s with Windows XP and Vista with IE6, IE7 and IE8, they have a time limit and they require a lot of disk space. I would have enjoyed not wasting 7 GB+ on them. Oh well.</p>

	<p>If anyone is interested, this is the link for the virtual images. You can run them with the free Microsoft Virtual PC on Windows.<br />

On Linux and Mac, I think VMware&#8217;s commercial products can use these images. You would also need something that can handle self-extracting (<span class="caps">EXE</span>) archives &#8212; 7-Zip probably can.</p>

	<p>And in case anyone is going to suggest IE Collection or other such methods of running multiple IEs side by side, Microsoft have warned against it:<br />
