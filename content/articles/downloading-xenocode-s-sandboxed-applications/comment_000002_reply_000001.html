<p>Other than with &#8220;portable&#8221; versions of the application, here the application stays unchanged. This is particularly important for Internet Explorer, fixing it up to make it &#8220;portable&#8221; would be quite hard. Instead, a virtualizer is started before the actual application, it changes the way the application sees the file system and registry. Accesses to particular directories and registry branches are &#8220;rerouted.&#8221; You can see these &#8220;overlays&#8221; under <span><span class="caps">LOCALAPPDATA</span></span>\Xenocode\Sandbox.</p>
