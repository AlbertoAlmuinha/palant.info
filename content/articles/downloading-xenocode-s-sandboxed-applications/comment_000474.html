	<p>Yes, the Spoon.net plugin (formerly Xenocode) no longer caches regular <span class="caps">EXE</span> files.  They now use an obfuscated proprietary format instead.</p>

	<p>You can still retrieve some of the <span class="caps">EXE</span>s from their server, but the <span class="caps">URL</span>s in the article have changed.  Here are some of the ones I was able to find:</p>

	<p>http://start-c.spoon.net/layers/chrome/1-0-154-43__2/chrome.exe<br />
http://start-c.spoon.net/layers/chrome/2-0-172-33__3/chrome.exe<br />
http://start-c.spoon.net/layers/firefox2/2-0-0-17__4/firefox2.exe<br />

	<p>If you need the <span class="caps">EXE</span> for another virtualized program not listed here, do this: (1) install the Spoon.net plugin, (2) run the program from Spoon.net, (3) look in the plugin cache folder (inside AppData on Windows), and (4) use the program name and version code you see listed in the cache folder to create a <span class="caps">URL</span> in the same format as above.  You may need to decrease the last number until you get a working <span class="caps">URL</span>.  Also, some of their very latest programs don&#8217;t seem to have any <span class="caps">EXE</span> files available for download (e.g. Opera 10).</p>
