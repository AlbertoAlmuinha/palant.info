	<p>Anyone able to solve the Buffering Error when trying to use the Spoon.net browsers plugin? I have the same error as mentioned in comment 9 and am unable to solve the problem. I would love to be able to utilize this plugin for web testing so any advice/help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>
