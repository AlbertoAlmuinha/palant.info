<p>Would setting a custom dns server in the browser cause the request to contain IP instead of domain since it has already been resolved? I don't know how antivirus intercepts the requests, but if its via the OS, removing the OS's responsibility of resolving the domain could make it look like the the user types the IP manually.</p>
