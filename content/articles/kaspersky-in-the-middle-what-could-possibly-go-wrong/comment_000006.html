<p>So basically this wright up(Except Injected Content in Edge) is about you disagreeing with Kaspersky's one click user https trust confirmation Police? I get that, but do not necessarily agree with you. "Normal" users as you state many times, will not be often exposed to invalid Certificates unless they are somehow extensively exploring the Web. No matter the way you present the warning, it is up to the user to decide the action. In my opinion the One Click policy is enough for warning the users, but I understand the point in having two click strategies. </p>
<p>Have you tried to disable HTTPS inspection? This stops the agent from intercepting traffic.....</p>
<p>And come on dude, what is up with that negative attitude towards Client Security Vendors? You have to remember that not everyone has the same technical knowledge and skillset to protect themselves proactively. Client Security is needed to protect against generic threats and malware for Billions of users who has other skills than IT &amp; Security. </p>
<p>Great work on the EDGE Injected Content. Hopefully disclosure is rewarded with their Bug Bounty program.</p>
