<p>I have been asking myself the same question. Antivirus vendors compete with built-in phishing and malware protection of the browsers which is usually based on Google Safe Browsing these days (Microsoft and Apple browsers being the notable exceptions). I have no idea how one would even approach validating the claims by antivirus vendors that they offer better protection here. There is also a typical weak point in their solution: they cannot check synchronously whether a website is malicious, so they allow it to load and will replace it after the fact. See also <a href="https://palant.de/2019/12/02/rendering-mcafee-web-protection-ineffective/" rel="nofollow">my research on the McAfee SiteAdvisor extension</a> (more to be published here later).</p>
<p>The other protection component is typically vetting of search results. Here they are competing with Google's and Bing's efforts to keep malicious websites out of the search index. Yet again, I have no idea on how an independent validation of the effectiveness would work.</p>
<p>Given how these "web antivirus" features are often flawed and how it is almost impossible to prove an effect, I'm inclined to recommend staying away from them. And - yes, it's definitely a good idea to disable these two settings in Kaspersky software.</p>
