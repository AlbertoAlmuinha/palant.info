<p>Yes, when going through the bug bounty program you have to agree to the terms. Here, that includes not disclosing bugs until they are fixed - and it's up to the vendor how long it takes. I didn't feel that this was important enough to push the matter for reports that they didn't consider a security risk. But the constant excuses got me pissed in the end, which is why I won't be reporting bugs via their bug bounty program again. I sent them three issue reports again today, based on not quite closed earlier reports - deadline is November 25th. No monetary reward in that case of course.</p>
