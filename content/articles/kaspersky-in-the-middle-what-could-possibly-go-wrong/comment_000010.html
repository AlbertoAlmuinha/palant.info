<p>Thank you very much for your detailed description of this issue. I found your arcticle during my research, if the internet security functions regarding browsing of different security vendors are making things better or worse. In terms of installing a middle man, I think your article shows quite clear, that it makes things worse. But I'm still wondering, if there is a benefit at all with actual / modern browsers like Firefox, Chrome and edge. The vendors of security software clame that they protect you against malicious websites, malware, pishing sites, websites containing Adware and so on. But do they really deliver a benefit above the built in functions of the modern browsers. Without being able to dive into this personally, I think they just do the same as modern browser do anyway but obviously in some cases even less secure (e.g. no OCSP stapling). I installed Kaspersky Anti Virus 2020 for evaluation. I chose the Anti Virus and not a suite (IS / TS) because I just wanted the basic features of an Anti Virus software on a Windows 8.1 machine. (I think under Win 8.1 the windows defender isn't sufficient.) But by default Kaspersky AV comes with Web-Anti-Virus and automatic browser implementation.
Would you suggest to deactivate Web-Anti-Virus at all or do you still see any benefit of that tool in conjunction with modern Browsers? Did I understand your article correctly, that you at least have to disable "Encryption connection scanning" AND "include scripting in datatraffic while interacting with websites".
Thank you very much for your reply!</p>
