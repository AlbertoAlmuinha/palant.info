<p>Good findings, thanks!</p>
<p>I  was wondering about the timeline: kaspersky seems to have tried to shaft you with the disclosure. Is there a reason you haven't given them a deadline for when you'll disclose these bugs? I guess that by submitting to their bounty program, you forfeit these rights for some (potential?) monetary compensation?
Would you submit bugs to that program again, or choose a more google-project-zero-style way next time?</p>
<p>I'm not involved in the bug bounty scene, so I'm sorry if this question is trivial.</p>
