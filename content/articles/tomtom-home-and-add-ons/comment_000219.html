<p>Wow, I never knew <span class="caps">TTH</span> was built on <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner. Great job, it&#8217;s actually a nice program to use.</p>

	<p>I do have a question not related to <span class="caps">TTH</span> add-ons but is related to the overall extensibility of the TT device itself. Why has the <span class="caps">SDK</span> been discontinued? There are a lot of cool programs such as SunTime and Tripmaster that no longer work 100% with the <span class="caps">GPS</span> device with the latest software upgrade because it inteferes with the <span class="caps">GPS</span> menus.  This decision seems to have effectively killed the developer community behind Tomtom. :(</p>
