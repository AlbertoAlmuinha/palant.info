<p>Hello,<br />
I found this page during my search for a tomtomhome feature.<br />
I&#8217;m in charge for support for more then 20 tomtom. With <span class="caps">TTH</span> I need for every device a new email-address. To much ;-)<br />
Is there a solution available to manage more than one device with one email-address?</p>

 Thanks in advance
  Norbert
