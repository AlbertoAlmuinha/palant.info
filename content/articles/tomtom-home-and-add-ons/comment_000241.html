	<p>I have been trying to get TT Home to work on Linux Mint 4 by using Wine. Since there currently is no Linux-version of TT Home availible to download, although I really hope it will be here soon!</p>

	<p>I can get TT Home 1.5 to work just fine as long as I connect my TT GO720 before I start up TT Home. It recognizes my device and I can use TT Home to manage the device.</p>

	<p>I have been wanting to use TT Home2 so that I can use MapShare. But I can not get it to work in the same way. I have tried version 2.3 on Wine, and it starts up and runs normal.But I can not get it to recognize my GO720, and it just keeps asking for me to connect the device to the PC.</p>

	<p>Do you have any tips or ideas why I get Home 1.5 to work just fine, but can&#8217;t get 2.3 to work in the same way??</p>
