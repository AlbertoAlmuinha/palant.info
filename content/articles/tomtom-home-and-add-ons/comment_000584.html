	<p>Hi Wladimir,</p>

	<p>thanks for your great work on AdBlock Plus and TomTom Home, and congratulations to TomTom for hiring a brilliant coder :)</p>

	<p>I stumbled upon this post looking for TomTom Home extensions: are there any already available, besides the Map Status Indicator, and the couple posted on the create.tomtom.com website?</p>

	<p>To be specific, I was looking for an easier way to do map corrections (speed limits in my area seem to be really variable, and selecting the right piece of road from the device UI is a pain in the neck). I think I get there&#8217;s no good news for me, but just to be sure&#8230;</p>

	<p>Thanks<br />
Mauro</p>
