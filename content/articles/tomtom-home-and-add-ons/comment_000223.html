	<p>Ah, ok.  The http://www.tomtom.com/home/ link doesn&#8217;t show any downloads when using a Linux browser, which confused me for quite a while.   Looks like the homelanding() javascript function on that page is detecting the OS and trying to displaying relative content.  Unfortunately, if the OS isn&#8217;t mac or windows, nothing displays.</p>

	<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ll keep waiting patiently.  :)</p>
