	<p>Hi, its nice to meet someone who writes for tomtom that actually know whats going on !. I write a bit of software called FreeICE that is free for CarPC users. Sadly (or good for tomtom) no one has written decent touch friendly gps software for the pc. whilst updating my tomtom go I noticed the tomtom emulator in tomtom home 2 and was most impressed with what it could do. Its such a shame that tomtom have coded up such an app that they dont sell to the public. Having tomtom on my carpc would make it fantastic. do you know if they would be releasing such software of if the emulator.dll could be adapted to work ?</p>

	<p>thanks for your time</p>
