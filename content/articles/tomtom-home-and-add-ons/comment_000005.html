	<p>Correct Wladmir, the link provided goes to the legacy <span class="caps">SDK</span> for devices running the Navcore 6.x firmware. However, all new TTs since mid-2007 use v7.x and are not fully compatible with the <span class="caps">SDK</span>. </p>

	<p>Even some <span class="caps">SDK</span> documentation would be useful at this point!  Anyway, I know it is not your responsibility, but if you do bump into any of the hardware engineers in the hall, give them heck.</p>
