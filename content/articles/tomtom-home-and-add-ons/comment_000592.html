	<p>I ´v got a navig.sys.on <span class="caps">DVD</span> in my Audi A8 and bought a Tom-Tom XL for driving in Estonia and Italy this year.<br />
I updated the Tom-Tom before going to Freiburg,Germ. on 10-09-´10 and drove back on 18-09-´10 via Strassbourg-Metz.<br />
There are works on the Highway around Metz since some month but my Tom-Tom only sent me on the usual way, neglected the works, while my <span class="caps">DVD</span> informed me of the changed situation. I expected more actuality of the Tom-Tom<br />
Sincerely, Hans Breuer</p>
