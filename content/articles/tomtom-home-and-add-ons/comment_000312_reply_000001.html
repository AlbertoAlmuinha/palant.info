<p>Supposedly, <span class="caps">DOM</span> Inspector should now be available via <a href="http://create.tomtom.com/developers/dom-inspector.html" rel="nofollow">http://create.tomtom.com/developers/dom-inspector.html</a> &#8211; but when I checked the link was broken of course. I&#8217;ll try to get that fixed (and make sure Venkman is published there as well).</p>
