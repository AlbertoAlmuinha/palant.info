<p>Sorry to hear this but what do you expect from me? I don&#8217;t even work for TomTom any more &#8211; and I never had anything to do with the maps. You might want to take a look at MapShare, contacting TomTom support is another option. Writing a complaint in a random blog which happened to mention TomTom won&#8217;t help you.</p>
