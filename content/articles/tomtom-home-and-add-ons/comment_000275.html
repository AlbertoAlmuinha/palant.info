<p>I plan to buy GO 930 tomorrow and I am so sad to see that linux based car <span class="caps">GPS</span> can update only with windows or mac.They use linux kernel and a lot of other open source packages but they don&#8217;t think (?) linux users worth tomtom home package to menage they devices. 10 000 000 of users world wide, they pretend, 400â‚¬ is the price of one <span class="caps">TTGO</span> 930 and they still can&#8217;t make it available for us. I am some kind of furious about this fact but thank you Wladimir for keeping us up to date with their plans. I don&#8217;t like windows nor mac and it hurts me so much thinking about dual boot with those systems. Any idea on some workarounds or testing I am also ready to test from tomorrow on. Cheers everybody</p>
