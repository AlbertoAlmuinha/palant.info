<p>Yes, I&#8217;m afraid there is no good news for you. There is some developer documentation under <a href="http://create.tomtom.com/developers/" rel="nofollow">http://create.tomtom.com/developers/</a> but TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span> extensions never picked up. Other than the map status indicator which I wrote and a bunch of extensions that were used only internally &#8211; there are no extensions. And writing this extension would be very hard anyway because <span class="caps">HOME</span> cannot read map corrections, it only acts as a mediator between the device and the server here.</p>

	<p>Oh, and I&#8217;m no longer working at TomTom &#8211; the blog post you are replying to is pretty old :) </p>
