	<p>I have been writing very little about what I am doing in my day job, maybe it is time to change this. As some might know, I am a developer in the team behind <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/home/">TomTom HOME</a>, an application that allows users to manage their TomTom navigator devices (e.g. installing new content on them, sharing it with other users or doing backups).</p>

	<p>TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span> is based on XULRunner, it runs basically on the same code as Firefox. This has many advantages for us, amongst others&nbsp;&mdash; support for add-ons comes with the platform, almost for free. Still, the usual add-on manager user interface don&#8217;t fit into the TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span> concept which is why only developers have been using add-ons until recently (<span class="caps">DOM</span> Inspector, Venkman, Live <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Headers, they have all been ported over). It has been a bumpy ride (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407329">bug 407329</a>) but with TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span> 2.2 end users can now install add-ons as well.</p>

	<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the work is done, it actually just started. The extension manager UI still needs some improvement, in particular updating add-ons should be easier. Also, currently you can only install add-ons from the TomTom server, anything else will have to be installed manually. We are still in the process of discussing how we can support installing add-ons from third-party sites while keeping security in mind. Most available add-ons right now are device emulators that will install automatically if you click &#8220;Operate my GO,&#8221; those don&#8217;t even show up in the add-on manager (yet?). Actually, there is only one user-visible add-on and virtually no documentation on creating add-ons for TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span>. Fortunately, I have four (4!) hours allocated during the current development cycle to create some documentation :)</p>

	<p>While we are still solving these issues, Roland Boon already started working on an <a href="http://rolandboon.net/kml2ov2/kml2ov2.htm">add-on to convert Google Earth points into TomTom Overlay points</a>. Roland is a fellow TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span> developer but he is working on the C++ part of it and has relatively little knowledge about the XUL/JavaScript part. He tries to use public information sources only and document the whole process. Want to contribute? His email address is on the page quoted above.</p>
