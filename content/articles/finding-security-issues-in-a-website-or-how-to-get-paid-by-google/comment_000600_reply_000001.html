<p>What you are saying is true for regular error pages like 404. However, in case of a bad redirect IE won&#8217;t show the content no matter what &#8211; I tried it with a large block of data just to be sure. Which doesn&#8217;t really mean that IE is immune to <span class="caps">HTTP</span> response splitting &#8211; it is only immune to this particular exploitation technique but there are many others.</p>
