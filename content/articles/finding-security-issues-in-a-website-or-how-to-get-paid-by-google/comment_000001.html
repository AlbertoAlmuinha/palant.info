	<p>Just an update on the <span class="caps">XSS</span> I posted. </p>

	<p>I see that the vulnerability is not your fault but rather anwiki. They <a href="http://bugs.anwiki.com/index.php?do=details&amp;task_id=135" rel="nofollow">just patched</a> an <span class="caps">XSS</span> hole but the one I posted is still live. Also, I&#8217;ve found quite a few other <span class="caps">XSS</span> and <span class="caps">CSRF</span> vulnerabilities in their app. It looks like they have no idea what they&#8217;re doing as far as security is concerned. Maybe think about switching <span class="caps">CMS</span>&#8217;s? No simple feat I know but worth considering.</p>
