<p>&#8220;oddly, iâ€™ve never found much use for spell checkers, in any language.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Give me a break, please.  Anyone can accidentally mistype a word.  It isn&#8217;t just about ability to spell.</p>

	<p>My main gripe with the inline spell checker of Firefox 2.0 is that the default US English dictionary sucks!  I&#8217;m constantly finding relatively simple, common words that aren&#8217;t in the dictionary.  This happens most commonly with tech words&#8212;such as &#8220;offline&#8221;.</p>
