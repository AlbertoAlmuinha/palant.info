	<p>::This post is to possibly give those with more knowledge ideas for what at least i would like to see and possibly others::</p>

	<p>I have no help but I have an idea if anyone knows how to make a spell check dictionary is to build combo dictionary&#8217;s people who live in the southwest like I do would like a English/Spanish dictionary and i believe there should be these type of combos for every language to combine it with English at least your situation is more complicated but if someone knows maybe they can make you an dictionary that would fit your needs. I am basically agreeing with you that when you download a dictionary they should combine so say you type in 3 different languages each one would combine so if anyone who knows how to possibly make an extension that combines your dictionary&#8217;s together or let you choose the dictionaries you want to use at the time rather than one language at a time. i don&#8217;t know how to make extensions but i believe it is a large problem with the firefox spell check i personally still have to use a separate website just to spell check because it is so unreliable. Also like word it should automatically capitalize each letter after a period. Just because many people have become used to it from frequent word usage.<br />
