	<p>What I&#8217;d like to be able to do is create your own dictionaries, and be able to say that one dictionary only works at this site, this site, and this site.  (Seeing as you can easily find a big website that has more than 2 supporting)</p>

	<p>I just can&#8217;t find a way to make special dictionaries that can be used.  (For example, a Developer&#8217;s Dictionary which has <span class="caps">CSS</span>  as a correct word)</p>
