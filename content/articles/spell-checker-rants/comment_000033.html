<p>I have problems in <span class="caps">EN-NZ</span> (New Zealand English) on &#8220;etc.&#8221;  &#8220;etc.&#8221; comes up misspelt, it suggests &#8220;etc.&#8221; and thus becomes &#8220;etc..&#8221;, which also comes up misspelt and so goes to &#8220;etc&#8230;&#8221; and so on.<br />
The spell checker reads the full stop as an end of sentence and thus not part of the abbreviation.  Grr.</p>
