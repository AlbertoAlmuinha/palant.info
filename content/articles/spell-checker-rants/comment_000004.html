	<p>oddly, i&#8217;ve never found much use for spell checkers, in any language..  </p>

	<p>dictionaries, yes.  Dictionary Tooltip extension is very good in its approach and allows fast switching to multiple languages from the same UI; if only one could have the dictionary files locally it would be perfect (or as good as the dictionary).</p>

	<p>non-ascii alphabets, yes.  years ago i scoured the web for a way to rapidly enter (any) UTF8 codes all on the same page with a US keyboard.  a highly customized Multikey (winOS app) did it; La città di Forlì, в котором żyłyśmy pięċ lat, daß uns gefällt, is a right nice town.</p>

	<p>not a big market for this stuff, but good for parlor tricks..</p>
