<p>Yes, steve already mentioned this extension above. I am already using it and the author is very responsive, he already fixed most of the issues with it. There is one more issue left connected to switching tabs while typing on sites where autodetection doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; once this is solved the extension will be perfect.</p>
