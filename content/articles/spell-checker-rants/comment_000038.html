	<p>Yes, however none of them would ever really be called &#8220;wrong&#8221;, though some might be considered a bit unprofessional depending on the context.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m not sure what functionality a separate spell checker would provide beyond what would by necessity already be inherent in a <em>wapuro</em> or an <span class="caps">IME</span> applet.  Kana are 100% regular apart from a handful of particles and kanji can&#8217;t really be misspelled on a PC in any normal sense.  I suppose it might be useful to catch typos if one were causually firing off an all-kana message.</p>
