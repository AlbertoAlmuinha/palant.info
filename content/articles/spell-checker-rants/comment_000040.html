	<p>French has similar issues since in common language c cedille is accepted as &#8220;c&#8221;, as in &#8220;Merci&#8221;. Same goes for most languages with very similar, but not identical to western, like Romanian who, by the book, has 5 additional letters, with their own sounds. While this is true for formal lettering, normal everyday typing involves substitution, as all 5 are derived off a(2), i, s and t (1 each). There are ambiguous cases, but it&#8217;s rarely an issue since the ambiguity is usually eliminated by context.</p>

	<p>I also hate it because ă and a, while they sound somewhat different, should be treated as same when looking for a suggestion.</p>

	<p>For example, partie (ski slope) is suggested as &#8220;patrie&#8221;, a full 2 letter and one sign away from the best choice, pârtie (pa^rtie for those with no CE).</p>

	<p>For longer words and more characters, it&#8217;s broken to the point of no more suggestion &#8211; even if an equivalence table would immediately correct all those.</p>

	<p>My best idea yet is to allow for equivalence letters. Example, Romanian &#8211; loose could be a spell checker with all the words auto-translated to replace â(a circumflex) with a. It would make it really useful for casual writing. In Romanian, more than one third of the words in normal use have these characters.</p>

	<p>â, ă = a<br />
î = i<br />
ş = s<br />
ţ = t</p>

	<p>Just ranting.</p>
