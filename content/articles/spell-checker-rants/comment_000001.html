	<p>Probably japanese, as there are multiple ways (and even alphabets!) to spell a certain word.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know if something like a spell checker for japanese even exists, and at the moment, my japanese is still too limited to find out (however, I should already be able to order food in a restaurant without offending more than two or three people ;-).</p>
