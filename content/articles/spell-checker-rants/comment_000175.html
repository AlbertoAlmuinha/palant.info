<p>Hmmmm &#8230;</p>

	<p>I love the spell checker as well &#8230;</p>

	<p>My major problem with it is that if you spell a word like THis  ... with two capital letters in a row &#8230; it marks it as misspelled &#8212; fine &#8212; but it has NO <span class="caps">CONCEPT</span> what the word should be. In the example above &#8230;</p>

	<p>suggestions include</p>

	<p>tris<br />
thighs<br />
thees<br />
thins<br />
his</p>

	<p>How is it possible that &#8220;this&#8221; could not be on the list???</p>
