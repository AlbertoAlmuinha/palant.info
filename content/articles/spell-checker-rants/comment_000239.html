<p>i am also not a big fan of the spell checker of thunder bird. my main concern is that it doesn&#8217;t capitalize things for you. i should be able to at least capitalize cities, the word &#8220;I&#8221; and after a period for crying out loud!</p>

	<p>i have to re-spell check my emails when i type them even after using spell checker. spelling isn&#8217;t my issue but capitalizing is.</p>
