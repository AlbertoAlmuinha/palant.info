	<p>The case where the spellchecking suggests &#8220;etc.&#8221; for &#8220;etc.&#8221; and then writes &#8220;etc..&#8221; goes for the German dictionary, too. Also, in German you don&#8217;t write &#8220;email&#8221;, because that means enamel in German, but you write &#8220;E-Mail&#8221; and this causes the Thunderbird spellchecking to handle it as two words. In the end, &#8220;E-Mail&#8221; gets the red underlining, though it&#8217;s in the dictionary.</p>
