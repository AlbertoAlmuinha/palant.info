<p>I already did. However, in the process I discovered the data siphoning performed by Avast, so <a href="https://palant.info/2020/01/13/pwning-avast-secure-browser-for-fun-and-profit/" rel="nofollow">only one article on Avast vulnerabilities</a> has been published. As I wrote there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did not finish my investigation of the other extensions which are part of the Avast Secure Browser. Given how deeply this product is compromised on another level, I did not feel that there was a point in making it more secure. In fact, I’m not going to write about the Avast Passwords issues I reported to Avast – nothing special here, yet another password manager that made several of the usual mistakes and put your data at risk.</p>
