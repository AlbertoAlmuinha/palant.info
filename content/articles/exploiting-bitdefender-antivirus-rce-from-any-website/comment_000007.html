<p>Hi, Wladimir Palant. I just came here from your latest comment on Malwaretips on the honey extension. Great research as always. Got me thinking about AVs HTTPS scanning again.
If you have the time, consider taking a look at ESET. They also do HTTPS scanning both on their Nod32 and Internet Security lineup. Another AV that comes to my mind who also does this is K7 from India. But ESET is of course far more popular so it would be interesting if you find any issue with their HTTPS scanning implementation. 
If you want check browser extension again then consider taking a look at Bitdefender's "TrafficLight" extension which is quite popular and also have search result scanning function that you discussed here. Another popular one is, "Malwarebytes Browser Guard" and also "Emsisoft Browser Security".<br>
Thanks.</p>
