	<p>Hi,<br />
As Tomtoms are working under linux, how can you explain that the application tomtomhome works only under windows and Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span>, and does not exist for linux ???<br />
Is it a trade agreement between tomtom and MS, or is there an other reason ?<br />
Is it so complicated to do ?</p>
