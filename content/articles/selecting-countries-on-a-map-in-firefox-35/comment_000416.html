<p>Wladimir, I agree that if you&#8217;re starting with an existing image that already has the countries all as different colors an imagemap would take more work&#8230;  That starting point was not obvious to me from a first glance at your demo.  I agree that it&#8217;s neat that you can exploit that starting point this easily.</p>
