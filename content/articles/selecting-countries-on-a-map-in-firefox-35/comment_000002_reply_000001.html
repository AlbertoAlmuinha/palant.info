<p>I guess that would work as well. But the image I had (which isn&#8217;t the one in this demo) wasn&#8217;t vectorized and there was no way to get it vectorized. Not to mention that I prefer keeping <span class="caps">SVG</span> to a minimum in a <span class="caps">XUL</span>/JavaScript app (most of the time you get auto-generated <span class="caps">SVG</span> which isn&#8217;t exactly well readable).</p>
