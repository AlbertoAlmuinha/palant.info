	<p>Wow, what amazing progress vendors have made in the 15 years of the web. Now we can do image maps a whole different way!</p>

	<p>Meanwhile those trying to match the hype about blending web and desktop struggle to cleanly implement simply and consistent accessible widgets such as calendar and time pickers with crappy JavaScript. These would be the same widgets desktop developers have been able to use since &#8230; oh yes, before the web even existed!</p>
