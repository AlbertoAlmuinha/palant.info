	<p>Impressive demo. But please don&#8217;t use this map for a real application, because it contains errors. The original data was based on population figures and doesn&#8217;t properly discriminate among different countries.</p>

	<p>For instance, if you select Island, then Luxembourg, Andorra, Cyprus, Malta and the Faroe Islands are selected too (same purple color in original, but not related). And the area around Kaliningrad has the same color as Russia, but they&#8217;re not selected together.</p>

	<p>PS : it&#8217;s fun to try to select Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City (obviously :-) ). You can enlarge the image, but even then it&#8217;s difficult.</p>
