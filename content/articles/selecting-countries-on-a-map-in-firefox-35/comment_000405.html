<p>As far as I know, <span class="caps">SVG</span> supports JavaScript. (I might be wrong about that, I have no practical experience with <span class="caps">SVG</span>.) Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to find a vectorized map where each country is an <span class="caps">SVG</span> object and put onClick handlers on these?</p>
