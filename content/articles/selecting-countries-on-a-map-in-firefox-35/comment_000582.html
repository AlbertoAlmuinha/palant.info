<p>I saw a couple examples of maps where users could color in visited countries of the world using a Google Maps interface, but the maps were too small and the country colors all the same. So me a newbie programmer wannabe, used old style image maps  and static <span class="caps">PNG</span> images from Wikipedia to create large maps that by default use colors from the country flags that contrast with neighboring countries.  </p>

	<p>Anyway I can see now that using <span class="caps">SVG</span> or Raphael would have been much simpler.  I like your example but it doesn&#8217;t seem to work in Chrome.</p>
