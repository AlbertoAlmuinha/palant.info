	<p>Not just image map? I guess not, that solution would require <strong>at least</strong> an onclick attribute to replace each section with a different coloured image!</p>

	<p>Admittedly it would be a huge <span class="caps">PITA</span> to get all the images right &#8230; but then, oh wait, <span class="caps">CSS</span> sprites would do the trick in seconds.</p>

	<p>I really want to believe in <span class="caps">SVG</span>. Show me something that only Flash can do atm &#8211; like vector tweening or something &#8211; in <span class="caps">SVG</span> and I might start to believe the bullshit about HTML5 kicking Flash and Silverlight. Really, which idiot came up with that story? And how the hell did it get through to the Slashdot front page?</p>

	<p>Question: how many Mozilla devs actually write web sites? Seems to me the closest they come is explaining their amazing new (but irrelevant?) code in some pre-canned web logging software like WordPress. Don&#8217;t get me wrong Wladamir, AdBlock Plus is invaluable but wouldn&#8217;t your experience coding for it have more to do with Firefox internals? </p>

	<p>Is it not simply possible that Mozilla devs are estranged from the needs of web developers because they do not write web sites?</p>
