<p>Right, I forgot to add a disclaimer that I didn&#8217;t bother making the map 100% politically correct. E.g. I simply made all the tiny countries and a bunch of islands the same color (this is not the fault of original image since I didn&#8217;t keep the colors from there, I simply didn&#8217;t want to spend too much time on it).</p>
