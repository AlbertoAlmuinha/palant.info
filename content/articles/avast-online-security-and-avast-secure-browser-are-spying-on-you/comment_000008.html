<p>Hi Mr Wladimir Palant, I have removed all avast products, Avast Anti Virus, Avast Secure Browser, Avast online security.
Now I don't know what anti virus I should use. I tried Kaspersky Cloud Security and I have read your topic about Kaspersky,
https://palant.de/2019/11/27/more-kaspersky-vulnerabilities-uninstalling-extensions-user-tracking-predictable-links/
so I removed Kaspersky Cloud Security.
What anti virus do you recommend? I loved Avast a lot , but after the bad news , I am afraid of using their anti virus although it is good, but who knows if it spies on people or not.
So can you please tell me what anti virus you recommend?
Thank You Very Much, Sir.</p>
