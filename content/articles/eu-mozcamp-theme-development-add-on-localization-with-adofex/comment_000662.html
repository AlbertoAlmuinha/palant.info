<p>I do have an alternative idea that would allow current themes to continue to function, make building new basic themes easy as pie, keep un-updated themes from breaking new features, keep themes from breaking &#8220;security&#8221; features, allow for a basic automated compatibility test, and generally make almost everyone happy.  It&#8217;s actually pretty simple and I don&#8217;t think it would even be that difficult to implement.  </p>

	<p>All Mozilla needs to do is to create another skin specifically for basic themes.  All that it would contain are the support files for the basic main window elements: main toolbars, main toolbarbuttons, urlbar, searchbar, tabs, main menu (top level), and bookmarks toolbar.  Everything else would stay in /browser/ and /global/ like they are now.  The main stylesheet in the new skin (let&#8217;s call it /theme/) could be @imported from /browser/browser.css so that old themes that don&#8217;t include that line wouldn&#8217;t load those files.  To be even more user-friendly the /theme/ skin could split up parts of browser.css into their components: searchbar.css, tabbrowser.css, toolbar.css, toolbarbutton.css, and urlbar.css. If security-related parts of the urlbar are left in /browser/ then these themes would be less likely to break Firefox&#8217;s security &#8220;standards&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Under that scheme it would be pretty easy to monitor these handful of files in bugzilla to create a compatibility flag for these kinds of themes, so that it may actually be possible to create a basic automated compatibility test on <span class="caps">AMO</span>.  If there are no new <strong>elements</strong> added to the parts of the UI styled by these few files then these themes would be automatically compatible.</p>
