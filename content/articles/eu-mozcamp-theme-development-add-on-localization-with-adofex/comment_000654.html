<p>Having all the default styles “built-in” (moving them to the content provider or whatever) would make implementation of more complex themes practically impossible.</p>

	<p>Notice that we already have the possibility to make a theme that &#8220;overrides&#8221; just desired rules. I&#8217;ve described this approach in this article: http://www.tudobom.de/articles/yatt/#light_weight</p>

	<p>This approach were discussed at MozillaZine here: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=1472225</p>

	<p>Of course this approach could be improved on the Mozilla side, removing, e.g., the necessity of the hackish registration of a &#8220;nonexistent&#8221; provider.</p>

	<p>So, in fact, we already have the choice to make simple themes with the override approach and more complex themes using the substitution approach.</p>
