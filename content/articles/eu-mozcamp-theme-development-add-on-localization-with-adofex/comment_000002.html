	<p>Modern certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to apply on top of any default theme. Perhaps the easiest way to go is to have chrome://package/skin/file.css automatically redirect to (say) chrome://package/content/skin/file.css (which would be the default theme) if the skin version doesn&#8217;t exist. This way when a new file is added, you get to fall back to the default theme, and you can then decide whether you want to override it, and if so whether to import the default anyway.</p>
