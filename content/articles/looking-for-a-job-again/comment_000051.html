	<p>Hi Wladimir!<br />
It&#8217;s always good to have a strong opinion! So do I. It&#8217;s better to have a strong one, than none!</p>

	<p>Please don&#8217;t work for Google&#8230;! I have a strong opinion about that. I think, it&#8217;s obvious that they want to dominate the IT market. I&#8217;d like to boycot them &#8211; I really do, except the search. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s really the best&#8230;<br />
In the German Wikipedia Google&#8217;s behaviour is summarized quite well:<br />
&#62; Googles Expansionsstrategie Ã¤hnelt der<br />
&#62; von Microsoft, nur agiert Google viel schneller.</p>

	<p>Good luck with your search!</p>

	<p>Regards,<br />
Adi K.</p>
