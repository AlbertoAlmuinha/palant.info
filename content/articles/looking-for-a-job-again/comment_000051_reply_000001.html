<p>Well, that&#8217;s your opinion. Mine is different &#8211; I have outmost respect for a company that manages to dominate the Internet by innovating. Having done web development myself for years, I can hardly understate the influence of Google on the web today, and that&#8217;s all-in-all a good influence (aside of the search, Gmail and AdSense have been important milestones <span class="caps">IMO</span>). Finally, judging Google by its deeds, this company obviously tries to put users first &#8211; and succeeds remarkably well for a stock-traded company.</p>
