	<p>Try talking to Wolfgang Denx and/or Detlef Zundel at <span class="caps">DENX</span> (www.denx.de). My top-level view is that they are a small company that does stuff (and gets paid) by big companies who are in a hurry and lack the core competencies present at Denx.</p>

	<p>They have a “core” company in Munich, but I know they use distributed resources.</p>

	<p>I have no idea whether there are positions open, or if the pay  is good or bad.</p>

	<p>If you mail me your email address I can <span class="caps">MAYBE</span> put you in touch with a recruiter that I trust.</p>

	<p>Take care.</p>
