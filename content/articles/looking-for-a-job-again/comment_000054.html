	<p>Hey,</p>

	<p>first I wish you a happy new year! :)</p>

	<p>Then I wish you good luck and hope you find a good job ;-)</p>

	<p>Well, why not try Opera Software ASA?! :D</p>

	<p>And bring all the open source stuff, extensions, <span class="caps">XUL</span>, XPinstall, etc. to Opera.. :-P</p>

	<p>best regards,</p>

	<p>iNsuRRecTiON</p>

	<p>PS: I would love to use Opera with extensions from/for Firefox, so Opera are compatible with the extension system from Mozilla/Firefox :)</p>
