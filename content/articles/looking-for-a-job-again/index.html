	<p>I should be finished with my PhD in May. What should I do once I am done? This question is bugging me right now. These three years have made it very clear that I don&#8217;t want to continue an academic career. I want to produce good software that will be used by real people, and sadly this is simply unrealistic being at a university. Most of the research produced will never turn into real applications, and even if it does, most of the time nobody will ever notice those.</p>

	<p>There is also a complicating factor&nbsp;&mdash; after spending three years away from my family and my fiancé, I really want to settle down in the area of Cologne or at least somewhere from where one can easily go to Cologne for a weekend. Finding a company in Germany where I could spend most of my time programming instead of fighting the process isn&#8217;t exactly easy. Add to this that I&#8217;m not the convenient type of employee&nbsp;&mdash; I have a strong opinion on just about anything and I won&#8217;t hesitate to tell it. All this together means that I don&#8217;t have all too many choices.</p>

	<p>My first choice was logically Mozilla Corporation. But after two months of negotiations and five interviews they turned me down because &#8220;we<br />
are going to focus on hiring locally&#8221;. Second on my list would be Google but from what I know all the serious work there is going on in Zürich. Moving to Zürich together with my fiancé isn&#8217;t impossible but very undesirable. Maybe MozDev Group is also a possibility though it is hard to tell what is going on there at the moment.</p>
