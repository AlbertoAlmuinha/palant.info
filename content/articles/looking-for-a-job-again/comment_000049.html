<p>Wladimir,</p>

	<p>Would you be willing to work with software developed on Visual Studio (Microsoft).  See &#8220;Double Image, Double Image-O&#8221; on my site.</p>

	<p>I am the owner, and single person here that works on the site, and software and need <span class="caps">HELP</span>.</p>

	<p>The plan is to bring the code more current to VS 7.0, add enhancements, and sell the entire thing, say to Symantec or other.</p>

	<p>I need a smart person to help carry this through.  </p>

	<p>I understand this would mean an investment of time and risk on your part with not the high pay you would get from the CORPs of the world.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>Bryant Kittelson, Pres.<br />
Host Interface International, Inc.</p>
