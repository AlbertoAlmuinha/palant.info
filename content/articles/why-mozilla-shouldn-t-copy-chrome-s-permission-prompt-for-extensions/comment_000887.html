<p>As a Chromium developer I can guarantee you that we did not design the permission system to &#8220;shift blame&#8221;.  As you allude to, this is a difficult space to create good solutions in.  We&#8217;re trying our best.  I agree with you that the current system is not perfect, but please stop implying that we&#8217;re so cynical and exploitative that we create bad UI just so we can pass the buck to someone else.  That&#8217;s both unfair and unwarranted.</p>
