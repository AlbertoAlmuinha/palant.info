	<p>Awesome post. I have been trying to explain this to people for a long time, but I couldn&#8217;t articulate as well as you put it. The tldr is perfectly succinct &#8211; &#8220;Permission prompts aren&#8217;t unlike certificate warnings used to be &#8211; scaring users away and training the rest of them to ignore warnings.&#8221;.</p>

	<p>The iOS/Android6 style of permission per action makes it more clear but shoot it destroys the experience. I guess first time only is ok, but I personally don&#8217;t like it. I think it&#8217;s still flawed. Say I wanted to read users passwords as they typed them. I would have a first time permission request on something benign like &#8220;insert smiley face for user&#8221;. That gives me permanent access, and in future I&#8217;m reading passwords.</p>

	<p>I just review the code before I use anything from Chrome Web Store. Not possible to do with Android apps though so I don&#8217;t use any except the brands I trust. From <span class="caps">AMO</span> I&#8217;m comfortable just using it (as long as it was reviewed).</p>
