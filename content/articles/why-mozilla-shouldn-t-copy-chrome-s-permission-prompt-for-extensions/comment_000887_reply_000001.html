<p>Peter, thank you for replying. This blog post is exaggerating of course and I&#8217;m sorry if that offended you. I am actually quite certain that the permission system was developed with good intentions, and I&#8217;ve witnessed part of the learning process which led to the current state (Chrome was pioneering in that space, there was not much previous experience). What I describe is the end result however which is still creating a very bad user experience, not unlike certificate prompts used to be. From the user&#8217;s point of view, Mozilla&#8217;s current solution is clearly superior &#8211; yet not everybody seems to appreciate that fact.</p>
