<p>I thought Mozilla was going to start blocking 3rd party cookies by default last year, but it looks like someone or something changed their minds: http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2013/11/06/firefox-cookie-blocking-effort-delayed-again-as-mozilla-commitment-wavers/</p>

	<p>I use Firefox Nighty w/ AdBlock Plus and I have 3rd party cookies disabled unless I&#8217;ve visited the site before. Knocks out quite a few of those tracking cookies.</p>
