	<p>I found a great tool for blocking/allowing cross site requests in RequestPolicy. It allows you to either use whitelist or blacklist mode (with whitelist mode breaking many websites) and it does this in an easy to use interface. No need for cryptic rules like in your article!</p>

	<p>There is also beta version 1.0 on RequestPolicy website with improved interface.</p>
