	<p>Wladimir &#8211; glad to hear you are doing well.  I always follow your (high quality) work as it progresses, and wondered where you were.  It sounds like you&#8217;ve managed to find some quality downtime. Just wanted to say congratulations, and you (and your efforts) are appreciated.</p>

	<p>-Andy</p>
