	<p>You&#8217;ve done such a great job!! </p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been a firefox user since v 1.0, but I discovered your extension until now thanks to&#8230; the guy who wrote a php script to block all firefox users (the one that says we are thieves)!</p>

	<p>Thanks a lot to that kid that is promoting your site&#8230; are you sure it&#8217;s not a market strategy of yours?? lol</p>
