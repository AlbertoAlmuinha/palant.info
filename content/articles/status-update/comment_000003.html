	<p>OMG! Thank you Wladimir for coming back online. I am <span class="caps">SOOOOO</span> glad to see you finally come back here. I was getting a bit worried when you told me your were going to write a blog but then didn&#8217;t. Someone needs to &#8216;stabilize&#8217; me from time to time around here :-)</p>

	<p>I am thrilled for your new apartment, your marriage, and your new job. I am glad that your life is going great for you and that you have finally showed up again.</p>
