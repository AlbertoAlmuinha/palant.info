<p>You probably noticed that I have been very quiet lately&nbsp;&mdash; I only managed to reply a few of the incoming mails, almost didn&#8217;t comment in bug reports and didn&#8217;t visit the Adblock Plus forum at all. Main reason is that I finally moved with my wife to our own apartment in Cologne and we simply didn&#8217;t have Internet at home yet. This means that I only had Internet access at work where I had already enough to do with getting TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span> 2.0 ready for a release (note that &#8220;at work&#8221; is a little abstract when you are working remotely, so far it was defined for me as &#8220;a place where I have Internet&#8221;).</p>

	<p>Other reason is of course that many (good) things kept me very busy&nbsp;&mdash; the new apartment (we like it very much but getting everything we need takes time), wedding celebration (surprisingly, almost everything went perfectly), our honeymoon (the weather in Cannes was perfect, and likewise everything else), new job (building a great application on top of Mozilla platform). I will spend the next week in Amsterdam, but in September I should finally catch up with everything I neglected for a while&nbsp;&mdash; including Adblock Plus.</p>
