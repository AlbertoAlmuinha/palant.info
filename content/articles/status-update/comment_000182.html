<p>I love the extension! Great work. I have an idea, which I am sure others have thought of, and someone may already be working on, but I think it would be good. Would it be possible to build an extension that would determine if a site, listed in the search results, was the same as an ad appearing in the search result page, and if so, eliminate both from view? This would be nice, since many of the sites with ads are there because of the ads. It could make for a much more honest search experience.</p>
