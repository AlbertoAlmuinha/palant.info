	<p>Wow there! Where do you get that impression from? I never said anything about &#8220;education deficiencies&#8221; or implied anything like that.</p>

	<p>I shared some reading tips on the subject as I suspected you could be interested in good, entertaining and fascinating reading material on the subject. I would not have referenced those books if I would have thought that you weren&#8217;t smart enough to cope with those books as they are not &#8220;light reading material for the average Joe&#8221;. </p>

	<p>If anything, my comment implied that I think you are <span class="caps">NOT</span> the &#8220;average Joe&#8221;. After reading your post, I was convinced you are one of the smarter people out there; someone who is smart enough to actually understand those books and because of this, sharing their titles made sense to me. That wasn&#8217;t an insult, that was a compliment!</p>

	<p>Reading my comment again and again, I really don&#8217;t understand how you ended up getting another impression. If you feel as if I&#8217;ve stepped on your toes, I&#8217;ll gladly state that your interpretation of my comment is faulty and I&#8217;m sorry you have been reading it the way you did. My comment was posted with the friendliest intentions. I hope you&#8217;ll be able to detect that in between the lines I wrote.</p>

	<p>Have a nice weekend,</p>

	<p>Sarah</p>
