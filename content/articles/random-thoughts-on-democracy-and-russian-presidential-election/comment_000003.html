	<p>Quoting wise men that are smarter than me: &#8220;Democracy is illusory, and only serves to mask the reality of elite rule.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Maybe you would like to read &#8220;Against the Masses&#8221; by &#8220;Joseph V. Femia&#8221; (Oxford 2001). Also, &#8220;The Open Society and its Enemies&#8221; by &#8220;Karl Raimund Popper&#8221; (1943) gives great insights on democracy in Germany after the second world war.</p>
