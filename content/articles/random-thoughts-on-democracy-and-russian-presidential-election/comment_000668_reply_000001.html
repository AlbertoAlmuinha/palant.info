<p>&#8220;Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.&#8221; Winston Churchill</p>

	<p>Where did I say that everything is fine in Germany? I actually said the exact opposite, democracy in Germany has its issues. Also, democracy in general isn&#8217;t a perfect system. Every individual citizen is bound to be regularly unhappy with the decisions made even in a perfect democracy. And a democracy is heavily dependent on informed and vigilant citizens that form their opinion rather than believing what others say &#8211; and stand by it. That&#8217;s still a big issue in Germany.</p>

	<p>Side note: Germany isn&#8217;t a direct democracy and doesn&#8217;t claim to be &#8211; direct democracy never works on a large scale. For example, the majority always tends to oppose change until the problems affect everybody. But a government has to act proactively, not reactively. The idea is to elect smart people into government who will know <strong>better</strong> than you what needs to be done. So &#8220;the government did something even though the majority opposed it&#8221; is a moot point if this something was better for everybody in the long term.</p>

	<p>But it is this comparison that makes you appreciate what you have. If you compare the state of democracy in Germany to Russia then you either didn&#8217;t read or didn&#8217;t understand my blog post. If you look at Russia you understand that there are some very basic things that you consider just natural &#8211; but they are not. Things like &#8220;vote fraud will be penalized&#8221;. Or: &#8220;newspapers are free to cover the election from their angle without fearing government sanctions&#8221; (whether that angle is &#8220;objective&#8221; is a different story). Or: &#8220;blaming inner problems on external scapegoats is not acceptable for mainstream parties&#8221;.</p>
