	<p>Germany a democracy? I don&#8217;t know where you live, but from my corner of Germany, things look quite different!</p>

	<p>Besides&#8230; ask yourself why every politician &#8220;does his/her&#8221; own thing and you can&#8217;t nail them down (unless you start a revolution like Russia would need one).</p>

	<p>And former chancellor &#8220;Gerhard Schröder&#8221; becoming a GasProm manager the day after he stopped being a chancellor raises the question: what else besides energy (gas from GasProm) are we importing from Russia.</p>

	<p>Do the &#8220;Änderungen im Datenvoratsspeicherungsgesetz ab 2013&#8221;, the &#8220;Erweiterte Meldepflichten seit 2005&#8221;, the &#8220;<span class="caps">GEZ</span> Gesetzesänderung ab 2013&#8221; and things like &#8220;Behördenübergreifender Datenaustausch seit 2011&#8221; ring a bell?</p>

	<p>If you think &#8220;all is fine&#8221; in Germany, you&#8217;re wrong. I have to wonder &#8211; after all, Germany&#8217;s media still is able to talk about all this &#8211; so you should know! </p>

	<p>As they say in Germany: &#8220;Unwissendheit schützt nicht&#8230;&#8221; </p>

	<p>Closing your eyes so you don&#8217;t see facts that evolve here will only result in one consequence: Germany will sooner or later become a system like the one we&#8217;re looking at in Russia.</p>

	<p>In the end I get the feeling you&#8217;ve missed to learn about German history and the rules that created the foundation this country has been rebuild upon after 1945. </p>

	<p>Germany is as Democratic as every other country: you vote, but who says your vote actually counts? The ones counting who are the same people/parties to be voted for? Great, so the &#8220;controlling party&#8221; is the &#8220;party to be voted for&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Nice&#8230; if I were a politician and someone would ask me: I would vote for myself. Who wouldn&#8217;t? And if there are some votes missing, I would finetune the results and team up with another party&#8230; just to make sure I stay in the Government. </p>

	<p>That&#8217;s what practically happens here since around and about 1956. Open <span class="caps">ANY</span> book about Germany&#8217;s recent history (after 1950) and you can read it for yourself!</p>

	<p>But let me give you a better and more recent example: did you get a chance to vote when it came to the point where Germany had to decide if we want the Euro (€) or not? No, you weren&#8217;t asked&#8230; they just did it. They did not care that more than 52% of the German public (according to <span class="caps">IMAP</span>) were opposed to it.</p>

	<p>As Wikipedia writes at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy :</p>

	<p>&#8220;Democracy is an egalitarian form of government in which all the citizens of a nation together determine public policy, the laws and the actions of their state, requiring that all citizens (meeting certain qualifications) have an equal opportunity to express their opinion.&#8221; </p>

	<p>So, when &#8220;they&#8221; (= politicians and elite families like &#8220;zu Gutenberg&#8221;) decide things and don&#8217;t ask for or even care about your and the majority&#8217;s expressed opinion, you are <span class="caps">NOT</span> living in a democracy. </p>

	<p>Guess you missed &#8220;Stutgart 21&#8221; and &#8220;Harz Gesetze&#8221; too, didn&#8217;t you? Wake up! You&#8217;ve been practically enslaved by the laws of the country you live in, and no one gave you a chance to express your opinion.</p>

	<p>You actually call this country a &#8220;democracy&#8221;? </p>

	<p><strong><span class="caps">LOL</span></strong> </p>

	<p>Welcome to the Russian system, my friend. Welcome to Germany!</p>
