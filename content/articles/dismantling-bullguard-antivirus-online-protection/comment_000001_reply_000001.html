<p>I'm not too much into attacking binary code which is what this would be about. In general, I know that Microsoft Defender has a very low attack surface, and running it in the sandbox definitely doesn't make things worse. I also looked into their browser extension a while ago and found it to be well-written. But that's as far as I go.</p>
