<p>Hello Sir, I've been reading your blog for quite some time already and I'm impressed with your findings. With that said, have you tried looking for bugs in Windows Defender's (now Microsoft Defender in W10 v.2004) optional sandbox mode? Microsoft said that this mode will lower the chances of attacks against the AV process to succeed. At the moment it is turned off by default, it would be interesting how well the sandboxed AV resist attacks or will it make detection poorer.</p>
