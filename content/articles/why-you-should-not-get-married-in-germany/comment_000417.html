<p>We are planing to get married in near future. But seeing such difficulties i wonder how would Germans run his own family.<br />
I have been in Germany as foreign student from India since 3 yrs.Since 2 yrs I got engaged with a Indian girl who has permanent residence n has been living since 10 yrs.She is divorced and and has a son from previous German Husband.<br />
Recently we planned of geting married in near future.We saw some options like Denmark .But not sure about it as Wladimir mentions Denmark marriage won&#8217;t be recognised.<br />
We appreciate your recommendations :)<br />
