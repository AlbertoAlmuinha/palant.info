	<p>Hey Wladimir,</p>

	<p>I am a german citizen, lived there for over twenty years, and I laughed when I read your article. The funny thing is, I went through the exact same thing with my american husband. It was ridiculous! The problem was that he was married once before. They told us they wanted a divorce certificate. So, he contacted the office in the state where they got divorced, we received the certificate, took it to the &#8220;Standesamt&#8221; to find out four weeks later that our marriage got denied by the judge. He needed a statement (I don&#8217;t know how its called in english but I think it is a statement) by the divorce lawyer, which my husband (<span class="caps">THANK</span> <span class="caps">GOD</span>) already had. ( I so did not understand this&#8230; the divorce certificate had the seal of the state <span class="caps">AND</span> the signature of the judge on it!!!)<br />
Anyways,<br />
We paid 60 Euros for the application and the lady at the office didn&#8217;t even tell us about this ridiculous price. She put the check in front of my nose and said &#8220;That would be 60 Euros, please!&#8221; I could feel my jaw dropping on her table (I just didn&#8217;t expect that much money for two signatures on an application, you know) <br />
Right at the same time we had also moved to the city (which still was in the same county) So, we went to the &#8220;Rathaus&#8221; where the &#8220;Standesamt was located in and told them that we had applied to get married and if they could please ask the other office to transfer our papers. Of course, we expected way too much of these productive working bees, which means that we had to apply again and this time it wasn&#8217;t 60 Euros for the application, no, it was 85 Euros! How wonderful! (&#8220;this better be a damn good marriage&#8221;, my husband told me) </p>

	<p>Anyways, I hope I&#8217;m not forgetting anything, after that we set a date and finally got married. </p>

	<p>Bureaucracy in germany is just the most incompetent, unorganized and inefficient bunch of idiots I have ever come across. <br />
(I guess before I moved to the states I was just used to it)</p>

	<p>Thank you for this article, at least I&#8217;m not the only one now  :)   </p>

	<p>Greetings,<br />
Christina</p>
