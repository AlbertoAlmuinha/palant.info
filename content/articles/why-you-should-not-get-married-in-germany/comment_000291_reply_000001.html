<p>Denmark is a lot easier, that&#8217;s where people often get married when the German way gets too hard. Problem is that such a marriage won&#8217;t be recognized by the German authorities unless you get together exactly the same amount of paper (or maybe even more) as when you just get married in Germany. And it isn&#8217;t fast either.</p>

	<p>I am afraid you will have to get married in Russia, at least unless your fiance can get a new visa. It used to be a relatively simple and fast procedure, at least when my parents got married &#8211; I doubt that Russia reached the German level of bureaucracy here yet. Expect that it will take at least half a year until your marriage is recognized in Germany, from what I know this is a pre-requisite for your fiance to get a residence permit here. And you have to stay married for three years before he can apply for a German citizenship (which will give him a permanent residence permit).</p>
