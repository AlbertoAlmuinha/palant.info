<p>On the bright side, I don&#8217;t think you will need &#8220;legalization&#8221; of your documents or anything else from Tanzanian embassy &#8211; I don&#8217;t think Germany trusts any documents from Tanzania, no matter who confirmed their authenticity. So you should get away with a statement under oath which is both faster and cheaper.</p>
