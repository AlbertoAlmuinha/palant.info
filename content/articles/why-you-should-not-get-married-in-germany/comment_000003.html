	<p>Yes, german bureaucracy sucks big time for marriages where at least one partner is non-german. A lot of those laws are in fact residuals from Imperial Germany(!), and nobody really cared to improve them. &#8220;Heiratsf√§higkeitszeugnis&#8221; is a very german thing, and can be <strong>very</strong> tough &#8211; and expensive &#8211; to obtain. Try getting one if you are from an african state and don&#8217;t even know your date of birth&#8230;</p>

	<p>If both are german, there have been significant improvements over the last decade or so, but most of them aren&#8217;t applicable to foreigners, even if they are citizens of another EU state.</p>

	<p>You of course hit the bureaucratic Jackpot by trying to get married as non-EU citizens. How dare you!</p>

	<p>You have my deepest sympathies, I promise to change this as soon as I rule the world ;-) &#8211; and I wish you both the best of luck and a great wedding.</p>
