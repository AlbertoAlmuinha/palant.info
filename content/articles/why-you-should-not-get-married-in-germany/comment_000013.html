	<p>Congratulations on your marriage. I am English (previously divorced) and my wife is Ukrainian. We married in Weiterstadt near Darmstadt in 2002. We had to go through all the hoops as well, such as translations, 2 trips to Kiev, wife travelling on the train to her home town for certificates, queuing at the German Embassy in Kiev, etc, etc, etc&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. All very annoying, time consuming and expensive. So much so that we still didn&#8217;t save for our honeymoon. We do have two wonderful children and are happily married and looking to emigrate <span class="caps">ASAP</span> !<br />
Good luck with your future together.</p>
