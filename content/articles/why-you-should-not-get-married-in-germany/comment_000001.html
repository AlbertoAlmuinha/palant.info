	<p>Not that this is of much comfort to you, but I it could be called a waiting period (with a high cost bonus) and maybe more people would be sure they really want to get married making the devoice rate much lower? I&#8217;m just trying to see a bright side for that mess. Here in the states you can get married on a whim and the devoice rate is <span class="caps">VERY</span> high. Just a thought. </p>

	<p>Sorry it was such a mess for you, but congrats to you and your fianc√©.</p>
