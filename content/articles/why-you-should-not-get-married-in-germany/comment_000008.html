	<p>Only 2 months, consider yourself happy !<br />
In the last 2 years, in France, it has become even more difficult : to marry my wife, Chinese, even with some higher officials&#8217; support and the family doing trips to Beijing to get papers, etc, it took us more than 6 months to finish everything&#8230;</p>
