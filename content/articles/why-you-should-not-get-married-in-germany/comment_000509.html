<p>Hi there,<br />
I&#8217;m planning to get married with my German girlfriend and currently living in Vietnam while she&#8217;s in Germany. Can any of you please tell me if it would be better/easier/faster for us to register for marriage in Germany (I come to Germany frequently for business) or we have to start all the paperwork from here ? I told her that I would prefer to come to Germany first with a tourist visa as usual and we both go to register there&#8230; Would be appreciated if you guys can tell me whether I&#8217;m allowed to do so by the German law !!! <br />
Thanks in advance</p>
