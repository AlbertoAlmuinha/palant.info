	<p>my fiance is from Russia and I am a German citizen. We want to get married in Germany but he only has a visa for 3 weeks&#8230; im guessing it will be more than impossible to get married in that short amount of time :( do any of you happen to know if there is any country in the EU where the  process is a lot faster? Would it be easier to get married in Russia?</p>
