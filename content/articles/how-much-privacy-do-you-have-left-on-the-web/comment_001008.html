<p>It is possible to create a protonmail.com email adress anonymously.
I did it the day before yesterday.
I did it in the TOR browser.
When they asked for authentification I had the choice betwen email, sms or donation.
So I set up a new anonymous outlook mail account to recieve the verification code.
All worked fine without registering any personal related information anywhere.</p>
