<p>Lowering barrier to entry is a good thing of course, but having people go into user interface design keeping the concepts from web page design is just asking for trouble. At the moment <span class="caps">XUL</span> at least requires you to relearn how a user interface is designed, you cannot reuse your experience with table-based layouts or other positioning hacks.</p>

	<p>I agree that getting better testing for widgets is a good thing (I meant to write this in the article but forgot). And <span class="caps">XUL</span> widgets in <span class="caps">HTML</span> will certainly be useful &#8211; for rich user interfaces in web pages. But these user interfaces will not have the look-and-feel of native applications or only with a huge effort, simply because <span class="caps">HTML</span> is not meant for that. We still need a small and focused language.</p>
