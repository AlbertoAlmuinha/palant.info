	<p>@Wladimir: Ok, than we have different definition of “developer” :) I don’t count every single person who happen to create “webpage” as developer :)<br />
But I agree that probably for every 100 developers there are more bad <span class="caps">HTML</span> developers than <span class="caps">XUL</span> ones. But that’s an effect of browsers forgiving minor (and major ;)) mistakes.<br />
Anyway I’m not advocating on <span class="caps">XHTML</span> over <span class="caps">XUL</span>. I just agree with Benjamin Smedberg that <span class="caps">XHTML</span> could be (successfully) used instead of <span class="caps">XUL</span>. But that will not happend :)</p>
