	<p>Well but if you’re developing in <span class="caps">XHTML</span> rather than <span class="caps">XUL</span> only for Gecko you also would not need to fix bugs for other browsers. So – no quirks mode.<br />
And table based layout isn’t evil. It’s abuse of table element which is bad. But, hey, you have display: table-*...<br />
So it looks like the only advantage <span class="caps">XUL</span> have over <span class="caps">XHTML</span> is that its developers can feel elite ;) But I’m not sure if it’s enough to maintain another HTML-like language ;)</p>
