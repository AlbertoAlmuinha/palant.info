<p><strong>I</strong> don’t need to fix bugs for other browsers, but <strong>the browser</strong> does. All the compatibility relics are still there and I have to deal with them when developing.</p>

	<p>And there is a &lt;grid&gt; element in <span class="caps">XUL</span> which allows for nice layouts – similar to <span class="caps">HTML</span> tables, but this element is really meant for positioning other elements. The result is that I have never seen messy layouts made with &lt;grid&gt;, yet a lot of those with <span class="caps">HTML</span> tables. Don’t forget that <span class="caps">HTML</span> table sizing is about the most complicated thing there is in <span class="caps">HTML</span> (partly because of backwards compatibility), so it is absolutely not suited for good user interface design (note: user interface and not document/web page). I already dread the hacks to implement automatic window sizing for dialogs with table-based layout.</p>
