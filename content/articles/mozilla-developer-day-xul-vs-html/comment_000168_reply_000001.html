<p>I don&#8217;t <strong>assume</strong> that <span class="caps">HTML</span> developers are handicapped &#8211; I know that most of them are. And &#8220;most&#8221; certainly doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;all&#8221; (I am doing web development myself), but the way you design a web page is radically different from the way you design a user interface.</p>

	<p>The whole point of using <span class="caps">HTML</span> for user interface development is making development simpler and more attractive to new developers &#8211; and that automatically means allowing bad practices, otherwise there is no point.</p>
