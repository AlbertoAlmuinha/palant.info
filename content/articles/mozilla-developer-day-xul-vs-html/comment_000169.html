	<p>I&#8217;m perfectly aware of webrunner and regularly read Finkle, but you wouldn&#8217;t know that.</p>

	<p>The worst element of IT is arrogant developers who ignore the wider community and separate themselves too far from the vast majority of the people in the world &#8211; users.</p>

	<p>To suggest that genuine Web Developers are not relevant to <span class="caps">XUL</span> is just pathetic. <span class="caps">XUL</span> is just another markup language, the same as <span class="caps">HTML</span>. If you all think you&#8217;re so important because you can write <span class="caps">XBL</span> in C and the average Web developer cant&#8217;t, you&#8217;ve got your heads stuck so far up your arses you cannot see the way out, a fact that is confirmed by moronic comments like &#8220;I know most web developers are handicapped&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Pull your head in (or out, of your arse, as the case may be)</p>
