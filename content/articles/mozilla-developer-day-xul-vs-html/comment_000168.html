So it is exactly what I said. You <ins>assume</ins> <span class="caps">HTML</span> developers are &#8220;handicapped&#8221;. They can only use obscure hacks, table layouts and bad design&#8230;<br />
Correct if I wrong but there plenty of bad C++ coders, Perl programmers and so on. <span class="caps">XUL</span> isn&#8217;t different.<br />
You should not fear <span class="caps">XHTML</span> as <span class="caps">XUL</span> replacement as long as Gecko wont allow bad practices to leak from &#8220;web HTML&#8221; to &#8220;UI HTML&#8221;. But that&#8217;s quite simple: if it is an extension, not a webpage, use only strict validating <span class="caps">XML</span> parser, no quirks mode, only <span class="caps">XHTML</span>.<br />
As for missing elements: ,  etc. &#8211; &#8220;X&#8221; in <span class="caps">XHTML</span> stands for &#8220;eXtensible&#8221;. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">XML</span>, it can have elements from different namespaces &#8211; just like <span class="caps">XUL</span>.<br />
Anyway, I suspect that it was simply easier to develop specialized language for <span class="caps">GUI</span> than extending language desiged for documents which also happen to give possibility to create <span class="caps">GUI</span> ;)</p>
