<p>I don&#8217;t know how <span class="caps">XUL</span> will transform, but a few things I believe&#8230;</p>

	<p>* There are vastly more people familiar with HTML+<span class="caps">CSS</span> than <span class="caps">XUL</span>. Lowering the barriers to developing Mozapps is a good thing.</p>

	<p>* My qualitative impression of <span class="caps">XUL</span> is that it has quite a few crufty corners where things don&#8217;t work quite right, and features which are unrefined. Having a more diverse set of <span class="caps">XUL</span> applications will help flush out problems and create justification for fixes, but greater commonality with the parts being banged on every day by billions of web pages is the best test-suite of all.</p>

	<p>* I hear people are doing crazy things with the web these days, like writing HTML-based applications/services to replace things that were traditionally desktop apps. :-) So, if <span class="caps">XUL</span> can do things <span class="caps">HTML</span> can not, then shouldn&#8217;t <span class="caps">HTML</span> be extended to support those things? Conversely, if <span class="caps">HTML</span> can do things <span class="caps">XUL</span> can not, then shouldn&#8217;t <span class="caps">XUL</span> be extended? At the hand-waving level this implies <span class="caps">XUL</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> share a convergent future, although practical details probably limit just how far any kind of unification can go&#8230;</p>

	<p>My $0.02! :-)</p>
