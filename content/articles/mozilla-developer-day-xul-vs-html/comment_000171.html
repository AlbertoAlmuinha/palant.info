<p>I&#8217;m well aware of HTML5 initiative and problems with <span class="caps">XHTML</span>. HTML5 is a great thing. I&#8217;m Opera user personally so I follow <span class="caps">WHATWG</span> effort from the beginning. It was about 2 years, I think, before it got into W3C. Also note that Hixie is writing about <span class="caps">XHTML</span> being pointless when sent as text/html. Note that as for now, only in <span class="caps">XML</span> serialization of HTML5 (well it&#8217;s XHTML5 :)) one can use elements from different namespaces (<span class="caps">SVG</span> etc.). <span class="caps">AFAIK</span> they&#8217;re working on this issue, though.<br />
The truth is, no matter how complex <span class="caps">XHTML</span> would be, Gecko have to support it anyway. As far as I know development in <span class="caps">XHTML</span> support haven&#8217;t stopped ;)<br />
Ok, to end this discussion: like I said I see the advantage of having specialized language for <span class="caps">GUI</span>. All I said is that there is nothing wrong in <span class="caps">XHTML</span> which prevents it from describing UI of the application. Actually it was already chosen as <span class="caps">GUI</span> language for Apple&#8217;s and Opera&#8217;s widgets. Of course it is not the same as normal application but&#8230;</p>
