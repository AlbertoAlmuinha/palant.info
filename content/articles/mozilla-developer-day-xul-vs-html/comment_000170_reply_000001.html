<p>I just look at <a href="http://xpoint.ru/forums/internet/html_css/css/forum.xhtml">http://xpoint.ru/forums/internet/html_css/css/forum.xhtml</a> and see what the usual solutions are when you have to deal with <span class="caps">HTML</span>. That’s a very professional forum frequented by very experienced web developers – but that’s not the kind of experience you would want to see applied to user interfaces.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">XHTML</span> was never an option in this discussion. The general consensus is that <span class="caps">XHTML</span> is already too complicated and <a href="http://www.glazman.org/weblog/dotclear/index.php?2006/10/29/2197-tim-berners-lee-thank-you" rel="nofollow" >doesn’t have a future anyway</a>. Having seen what usually <a href="http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml" rel="nofollow" >comes out when web developers attempt to use XHTML</a> I tend to agree – even experienced web developers rarely understand what <span class="caps">XHTML</span> is about.</p>
