<p>Yes, Boris already explained why some security bugs stay open way too long. There are some exceptions (and also some bugs that were simply forgotten), but the main issue is Gecko-based products that are updated much less frequently than Firefox. This is a very suboptimal situation, and I hope that Mozilla will eventually address it at the source (meaning more timely updates for those products).</p>
