	<p>Regarding bug 1005584 specifically (while recognizing you mentioned it as one of a class, not something to fixate on).  Maybe Boris followed up directly, I dunno.  But in case he didn&#8217;t.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t have any special information on that bug, beyond what I can see in it &#8212; so no offline discussions, <span class="caps">IRC</span> private-message discussions, things of that nature.  (But still access to that particular security bug, admittedly more than all but a few people have.)  But if I read the bug correctly, particularly comment 46 (feel free to check me eventually!), there&#8217;s a specific reason that bug remains closed, that&#8217;s unrelated to your concerns, that &#8212; given I lack full context on that bug &#8212; I won&#8217;t attempt to explain, even hand-wavily.</p>

	<p>I agree security bugs can just be frustrating, tho.  Even security group members have been hit here, recently, as security-bug access has become increasingly compartmentalized by team.  (So for example I can usually access JS bugs, but by default I can&#8217;t always access even those <span class="caps">DOM</span> bugs that are relevant to me.)  This is of course totally #securitygroupproblems.  :-)  But the point remains that security often mucks things up and hinders the flow of useful information, and nobody likes it.</p>
