<p>Contributing isn&#8217;t hard &#8211; for me that is. But for somebody who has never done it the process outlined on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction</a> is rather overwhelming. And that one doesn&#8217;t even mention unit tests, which is something new contributors frequently seem to fail at. Back in 2004 I outlined a bunch of code issues in a bug and then some Brendan Eich guy jumped in and fixed them &#8211; that was great, because I wouldn&#8217;t even have known how to test the changes in a build. And &#8211; sure, I know that I simply got lucky there and I don&#8217;t really have any solutions to offer. It&#8217;s really complicated as I said already. I merely have the impression that the discussion around making contributing simpler more or less died away.</p>

	<p>As to getting relevant information: Mozilla employees aren&#8217;t really in the same position there, simply because they always have somebody who can tell them what information sources to follow. Also, they have eight hours a day to spend on their project &#8211; staying up-to-date is part of the job description. Contributors who just need to figure out something don&#8217;t have anybody to tell them what is relevant and what isn&#8217;t, and they typically don&#8217;t have the time to read everything. That clearly is something that <em>can</em> be solved, by documenting the most relevant information sources for each project and making that documentation easy to find. But that also implies that some channels have to be used consistently for all important communication, even if it means duplicating discussions.</p>
