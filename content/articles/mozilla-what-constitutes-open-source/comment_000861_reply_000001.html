<p>Actually, the discussion around <span class="caps">NPAPI</span> removal has been going on for a while, and plenty of rationale has been given. Sure, issues during the transitioning period aren&#8217;t really avoidable. But adding support for legacy features to new platforms (and 64 bit Firefox <em>is</em> a new platform) doesn&#8217;t make much sense. As you might have noticed, Mozilla is addressing this problem from a different angle: by making the problematic websites switch away from Silverlight. They have to do that anyway, in order to support Chrome and Edge, so it&#8217;s only a matter of time.</p>
