<p>I cannot confirm that. I just went through <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox/" rel="nofollow">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox/</a> again and there is still this issue: most bugs all the way down to Firefox 31 are still closed, and even bug 1005584 which was fixed in Firefox 30. This makes very little sense security-wise given that the current <span class="caps">ESR</span> is Firefox 38, and that finding the change by bug number is trivial.</p>

	<p>Note that this policy was never applied to projects other than Gecko/Firefox in the first place. For <span class="caps">AMO</span> changes for example I always had to ask, otherwise the bugs would stack locked forever.</p>
