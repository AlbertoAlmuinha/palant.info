<p>How is contributing hard atm? I mean, I would really like to know so that we can improve that. I try to prioritize reviews from non-Moco employees over the ones coming from employees, and I think many others have the same principal.<br />
(though, I admit, right now there is a review from a non-MoCo employee which has waited for too long, it is just that it is rather difficult one and there has been plenty of other review requests).</p>

	<p>And about decision transparency, that seems to vary greatly depending on the subject. Core Gecko decisions, at least the ones I know about,<br />
<em>very</em> rarely happen behind the closed doors, and I for example don&#8217;t participate to any &#8216;hidden&#8217; meetings (except workweeks, but I don&#8217;t think anything really new related to core Gecko work has ever decided there) about what we should do next. It is all in bugzilla, <span class="caps">IRC</span> and newsgroups/mailing-lists. You&#8217;re very right that &#8220;the sheer amount of information&#8221; is hard to manage if you&#8217;re not following all the channels, often<br />
including also external channels like what is happening in WhatWG or W3C. But that has nothing to do whether you&#8217;re paid or volunteer contributor, it is equally hard for them both.</p>

	<p>In the core Gecko level at least meritocracy is very much still there. As a good example you <em>must</em> get a <span class="caps">DOM</span> peer review for any webidl changes, otherwise commit hook will prevent pushing the patch. (webidl is the way to express the <span class="caps">API</span>s Gecko exposes to the web.)</p>
