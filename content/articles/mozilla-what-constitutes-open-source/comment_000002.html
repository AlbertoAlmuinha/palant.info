	<p>Mozilla certainly has the same policy we always had for security bugs: we open them up once we&#8217;ve dropped support for the versions affected by the bug.  That&#8217;s if we ignore complications around bugs that also affect other software projects.</p>

	<p>What that means in practice is that if a security fix is not backported to an <span class="caps">ESR</span>, then it stays hidden until the next <span class="caps">ESR</span> release.  I expect that&#8217;s the long pole on opening up security bugs nowadays&#8230;</p>

	<p>For the rest, I think the issue with reviews is <em>very</em> strongly module-dependent.  And I agree that the decisionmaking has been becoming more opaque.  :(</p>
