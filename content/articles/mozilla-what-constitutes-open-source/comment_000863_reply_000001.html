<p>Sure, most Jetpack-based add-ons are breaking out of the sandbox &#8211; not because they like that, but simply because there is no other option. Mozilla finally decided to invest some resources into giving add-on developers the <span class="caps">API</span>s they need, so why not add them to Jetpack? Once the <span class="caps">API</span>s are in place, the low-level <span class="caps">API</span>s could be deprecated &#8211; meaning warnings in Browser Console, pushback on add-on reviews etc. You know the drill, this has been done a number of times already, also for Jetpack changes. The difference to WebExtensions is: no trial-and-error developing everything from scratch (Google devs have some experience with their <span class="caps">API</span> concepts but Mozilla has none), a clear migration path for existing extensions instead of boiling the ocean, existing knowledge of the extension developers can be reused. Sure, nobody can claim that this could be done in six months &#8211; but that timeline is completely unrealistic for WebExtensions as well.</p>

	<p>Yes, Jetpack has technical debt &#8211; but so do Chrome <span class="caps">API</span>s. People seem to have been overestimating the former and massively underestimating the latter (mostly because they weren&#8217;t familiar with Chrome extensions). And compatibility with existing add-ons is a bogus argument in my opinion &#8211; it&#8217;s one that gets you into the bug-for-bug compatibility hell and limits your ability to innovate.</p>
