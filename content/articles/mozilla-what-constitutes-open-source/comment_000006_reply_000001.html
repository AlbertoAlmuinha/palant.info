<p>As I said, I was not surprised by <span class="caps">XUL</span> being deprecated &#8211; it was obvious that this would come eventually. The weird part was the fact that the Add-on <span class="caps">SDK</span> was de facto deprecated at the same time (just after it finally matured with <span class="caps">JPM</span> and Firefox 38), and that the people involved didn&#8217;t seem to be aware of the shortcomings of Chrome&#8217;s extension <span class="caps">API</span>s that they decided to copy. When I asked people kept arguing that the Add-on <span class="caps">SDK</span> underachieved &#8211; but it never had the kind of resources that were committed to WebExtensions now. I cannot shake off the feeling that WebExtensions are a seriously misinformed decision, people deciding to start from scratch just because that&#8217;s more interesting than improving what you already have. But it&#8217;s clearly too late to discuss that now, now we can only talk about WebExtensions implementation details.</p>
