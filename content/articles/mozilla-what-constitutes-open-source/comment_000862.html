<p>If Firefox doesn&#8217;t provide unique, why users would use it instead of Edge or Chrome? Sites will be working fine in them, Edge is built-in in majority of desktop OSes, Chrome is providing integration with Google services, what Firefox will provide? Better &#8220;privacy&#8221;? Doesn&#8217;t looks like users really care about it, despite all fuzz from Mozilla regarding that, Firefox market share doesn&#8217;t grow (or even shrink).<br />
And personally I don&#8217;t care about Silverlight much, more about other plugins (gaming, corporate, etc), throwing people using them away, or forcing to pay for updating to &#8220;new technologies&#8221; doesn&#8217;t looks like good plan</p>
