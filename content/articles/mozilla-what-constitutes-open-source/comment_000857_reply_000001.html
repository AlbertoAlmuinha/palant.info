<p>As I said, finding Firefox source code is easy. Maybe I&#8217;m going in too deep by I&#8217;m currently aware of at least five Mozilla organizations on GitHub: mozilla, mozilla-jetpack, mozilla-services, mozilla-metrics and mozillaweb. And I know by now that Mozilla&#8217;s crash processing server is called &#8220;socorro&#8221; and that <span class="caps">AMO</span> is called &#8220;olympia&#8221; &#8211; but getting there took some time.</p>

	<p>As to lack of context in bugs, the most recent example was <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1197206" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1197206</a> vs. <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1210498" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1210498</a> (I filed the latter because I had no idea what the former was about). I cannot help with specific examples from Firefox right now, but I&#8217;ve definitely hit a number of bugs simply referencing some internal (or unlinked) spec without bothering to provide sufficient information.</p>

	<p>You can probably guess what decision got me surprised the most lately and was presented as a fact: WebExtensions. So far I&#8217;m not aware of any attempts to consult the add-on developers about the shortcomings of the current add-on system (or Chrome&#8217;s) before making a decision. Not just that, it seems that people with relevant experience within Mozilla were left out as well.</p>

	<p>If you want to know specific examples of Mozilla Blog posts, there is for example <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2014/08/21/trust-should-be-the-currency/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2014/08/21/trust-should-be-the-currency/</a> and its sequel <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/09/24/mozillas-vision-for-a-healthy-sustainable-web/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/09/24/mozillas-vision-for-a-healthy-sustainable-web/</a>. Maybe that&#8217;s just because I have a bit of experience in this area, but the attempts to declare privacy as the central problem and deny all other aspects here seem extremely constructed.</p>
