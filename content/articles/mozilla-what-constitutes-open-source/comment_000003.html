	<p>As someone who&#8217;s been involved with Mozilla for a long time and is now an employee, it made me sad to read this post. I don&#8217;t recognize the Mozilla you describe.</p>

	<p>For source code &#8211; can you explain what you mean by &#8220;cryptic codenames&#8221; and &#8220;various github organizations&#8221; ? I&#8217;m only aware of one Mozilla github organization, and you don&#8217;t need any code from github to build mozilla-central into Firefox &#8211; just hg.m.o.</p>

	<p>As for commits &#8211; at least in hg.m.o, I&#8217;m pretty sure the only commits without anything besides a bug number and reviewer are security-related commits. What other commits are you seeing that only list bug numbers?</p>

	<p>We are actively working to make contributing to Mozilla easier. We&#8217;ve improved triage in bugzilla (ie more bugs filed are now getting attention more like what you described Brendan did to yours), we are improving our reviewing tools, people are working on making it possible to submit pull requests from github through that infrastructure (I think scheduled for Q4, but don&#8217;t quote me on that), we&#8217;ve improved our build system and are continuing to do so (so that for frontend changes, you will no longer need to compile all the native code), we&#8217;ve improved our mentoring infrastructure immensely (mentor field on bugs, http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/, etc.), we&#8217;re getting people involved through outreachy &#8211; a lot of us are actively involved with making this better.</p>

	<p>Unlike the other sections, you didn&#8217;t really provide specific examples regarding contributing as to what was difficult, beyond &#8220;long review times&#8221;. I think the difficult thing used to be finding a reviewer (which bugzilla now helps with)&#8230; I deal with most if not all review requests with 1 day, and I know a number of the other Firefox peers have similar goals for how they treat reviews. (Ironically, I&#8217;m at a conference tomorrow until Wednesday, and so I&#8217;m not accepting review requests at the moment &#8211; because I know that it would be difficult or impossible for me to do them in a timely manner. Others on the Firefox team will be able to do them. I believe that now that we make this explicit in bugzilla (ie it is actually impossible to ask me to review your patch during these days), that is actually better than accepting the requests and then not replying to them for a week.). I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s currently a way to easily search for outstanding delayed review requests in a module. I&#8217;ll ping some of the folks on the contribution/community teams to see what&#8217;s happening to improve that (and to suggest a few things). In the meantime, if you know of languishing review requests in the Firefox product, please consider this an explicit request to needinfo me on those bugs (which I&#8217;ve not blocked while I&#8217;m away). I&#8217;ll either deal with them myself or try to forward them to an appropriate person.</p>

	<p>For discussion and decisionmaking: everything I&#8217;ve ever been involved with has been discussed on mailing lists, which are almost all mirrored to newsgroups &amp; google groups. We moved Firefox discussions to firefox-dev (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/firefox-dev) a few years back, which is mirrored to Google Groups but not the newsgroups, because it is a moderated list (and we can&#8217;t moderate <span class="caps">NNTP</span>). Planet is not normally used for structured discussion about projects, though people sometimes post updates about things they find exciting. I don&#8217;t know of any decisions (or discussions) relating to Firefox development that happen on Discourse.</p>

	<p>The Mozilla project is pretty big though &#8211; it seems to me like generally, people figure out &#8220;which bit&#8221; they want to get involved with, and then they go do that, and in the process they realize which parts of the firehose are in use by that part of the project. That makes sense to me: newsgroups and <span class="caps">IRC</span> are not an easy medium for discussions about web literacy and digital rights with people whose core competency isn&#8217;t engineering. Likewise, if you told all the engineers they&#8217;d have to move away from those technologies to Discourse or airmo, I expect there&#8217;d be uproar. :-)</p>

	<p>I&#8217;d also say a lot of what I do day-to-day doesn&#8217;t need structured decision-making. Of course we should fix security bugs; of course we should make Firefox work properly with on-screen keyboards on Windows tablets; etc. etc.<br />
Do you have concrete examples of what decisions you felt were made behind closed doors and should have involved the community earlier?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m also a bit mystified about the &#8220;strange statements on the Mozilla blog&#8221;. I looked through the last few months of posts on blog.mozilla.org. I didn&#8217;t see anything surprising (we work on webmaker, Firefox Hello, open video, policy stuff about net neutrality, board/org shuffles that warrant publishing about &#8230; which bit of that is surprising? Did I miss it?). Can you be more explicit about what surprised you or needed an explanation?</p>
