	<p>Wladimir, I hear you. I was a Mozilla employee for a few years from 2010 to 2014. During that time, I initially tried to behave as if I were &#8220;just another contributor&#8221; in an open-source project, and I initially tried to spend as much time as possible mentoring new contributors, and I tried to document status and projects on wiki pages. What killed that in my experience was:</p>

	<p>1) with the shift to &#8220;mobile&#8221; and Firefox OS and generally the top-down reorg that we saw between 2011 and 2013, it became had to argue for doing anything that didn&#8217;t fit in our quarterly goals (which, for engineers like us, consisted mostly of steps required to make mobile / Firefox OS work).</p>

	<p>2) with mozilla becoming a larger organization, more things became political, including in engineering (especially under the rule of the evil two-headed <span class="caps">CTO</span> and its lieutenants). So a lot of &#8220;decisions&#8221; didn&#8217;t have a very rational justification that could have been explained on a public wiki page.</p>
