<p>So the repository names&#8230; I don&#8217;t know &#8211; all I use in mozilla&#8217;s github repos is gecko-dev (for <span class="caps">CVS</span> history) and readability, both of which are pretty clear in their purpose. I don&#8217;t know why webdev and IT use codenames for their repos, but I agree that it isn&#8217;t likely to be conducive to contribution&#8230;</p>

	<p>Regarding the posts you flagged, Denelle is &#8220;Chief Legal and Business Officer at Mozilla Corporation&#8221; as it says on the blogpost. I think the first post is more related to trust than privacy, but either way &#8211; they don&#8217;t seem that different from other legal/policy posts we&#8217;ve had in the past when we had different legal counsel. I&#8217;m sure you could email Denelle or legal if you think they&#8217;re missing something important &#8211; but yes, it probably does have something to do with your perspective. I didn&#8217;t bother reading the posts at the time they were posted, as they clearly spoke about our views, intentions and mission (which I guess I assume I am familiar with), rather than about concrete steps we are/aren&#8217;t taking (which obviously does change, and so it tends to be worth reading about)&#8230; :-)</p>

	<p>The WebExtensions thing&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry if you felt that came as a surprise. No, I didn&#8217;t think it was a surprise, and I couldn&#8217;t guess that it was what you were going to bring up. This was discussed pretty extensively at Whistler, and I had heard mention of it before then. I&#8217;m not sure to what degree there was secrecy about this rather than just people starting to work on it because they thought it was a good idea, and not finding it necessary to talk about it until it was more than just a concept. I would agree that there wasn&#8217;t a wide pre-initial-implementation discussion to sort of ask permission/guidance from people outside MoCo to do it. I also think that the community outside of MoCo is <strong>now</strong> pretty involved in both that and the other work going on with add-ons. I&#8217;m not sure to what degree it makes sense to talk about pre-decision there&#8230; What would you have wanted people at MoCo to do instead?</p>

	<p>The thing is, this doesn&#8217;t seem to me as a thing we&#8217;re doing for its own sake &#8211; it&#8217;s a consequence of other realities. Take <span class="caps">XUL</span>. Its bad interactions with <span class="caps">HTML</span> layout and its poor support for commonly desired things (&lt;label class=&#8220;text-link&#8221;/&gt; is horrible and needs to go away) both mean that it&#8217;s often clunky and hard to work with, and it doesn&#8217;t help people contribute, either (which was one of your other points&#8230;). The tight link between the implementation of Firefox and add-ons caused by the <span class="caps">XUL</span> style of writing add-ons is constantly causing issues. The final nail in the coffin is security and tabs-in-a-separate-process. We could have decided to do a third go at the &#8220;add-on&#8221; concept that wasn&#8217;t webextensions, which would have been just as hard to switch to for existing add-ons, but on top of that we would have been left as the only browser beside Edge, Chrome, Opera, &#8230; that didn&#8217;t support the existing de facto standard. I guess I don&#8217;t really see what the alternative was, and from that perspective it feels much less like a decision.</p>
