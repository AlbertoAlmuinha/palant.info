	<p>yes my understanding is that chrome plugin separation only helps to reduce browser crashes when the plugins fail.<br />
from a security point of view it solves nothing for now, the plugins are still wide open.</p>

	<p>i read that they tried and failed to reduce the privileges, then the plugins would not work in a useful way anymore.</p>
