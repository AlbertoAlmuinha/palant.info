	<p>Browsers could try to alleviate the problem of &#8220;automatic&#8221; plugin (and in case of Firefox add-on) installation by disabling any plugin that is not whitelisted by the browser by default, and then present the user with UI to ask if the plugin should be enabled, every time it detects a new plugin.</p>

	<p>The UI for this would be tricky (because users often don&#8217;t have more information than the plugin name &#8212; which can be quite cryptic), but it could be a first step. I could also imagine a situation where future plugins would be required to carry more metadata (vendor, description, signing information) to be considered compatible by a browser at all.</p>

	<p>It pains me that after every software installation, I have to check in my browser if an unwanted plugin was installed as a side-effect.</p>
