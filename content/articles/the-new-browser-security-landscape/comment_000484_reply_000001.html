<p>Sandboxing won&#8217;t prevent malware code from running (which is what is being counted there) &#8211; but it will hopefully prevent it from changing the system in any way, so that code will be gone once you close the browser. On the other hand, maybe it is simpler and Erunno is right &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure whether Chrome is sandboxing plugins, I just thought that I read this somewhere.</p>
