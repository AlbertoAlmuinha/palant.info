<p>Last time I upgraded Java it again tried to install some crap on my machine, some toolbar if I remember correctly. This was a few months ago (I don&#8217;t have it installed any more). Did something change? And do the updates install with a single click (or even fully automatically) these days without having to answer questions you already answered before?</p>
