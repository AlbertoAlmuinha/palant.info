<p>This is great input: http://www.bu.edu/webcentral/learning/vista/howto/updatejava.html but I do not have the Java Control Panel in my Control Panel under Programs/Features or in the Additional Options for my laptop, but I do for the desktop. On the laptop it will not open from the Start Menu when I search and find it, it just opens the Java File location under Systems 32. </p>

	<p>On the desktop I open Java Control Panel and select Advanced and want it to default to Firefox as my default browser but it has Internet Explorer checked and grayed out so I cannot make Mozilla the default. If I mark it and do not hit OK and just keep it open all the time I am online I guess both are active, who knows? </p>

	<p>I even took IE off the computer, do not need both anyway, and it still doesn&#8217;t work. So what works for some is apparently not working for all. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled Java several times cleaning the computer of any <span class="caps">JRE</span> pieces. Using Windows Uninstaller Cleaner and cleaning the registry. It is very annoying and if you cannot pay $59.99 for 30 minutes of help, no guarantees it is fixed in 30 minutes, then you are on your own and thank goodness we find sites/blogs that can sometimes help us out.</p>

	<p>Addressing this statement: &#8220;And going to Tools / Add-ons / Plugins and disabling all plugins that you donâ€™t need keeps you even safer (I only have Mozilla Default Plugin and Flash enabled).&#8221; I also checked this out and Flash is not listed for me to enable. When I go to Add Plugins and look in the online list it states my Shockwave Flash is up to date. </p>

	<p>When I go to Java to have the site check to see if I have Java, it tells me I don&#8217;t or that I have below 1.?. I immediately go to the link, on same screen, that lets you test it and it displays animation and states I have the latest at 6 Update 18. It cannot be both ways.</p>

	<p>So overall it seems to vary from user to user. Would be great to have consistency with software companies playing nice with one another again. I recently left IE for Firefox but had these issues with Java and Adobe Flash Player not being in Additions (Plugs) on IE as well as the other issues I still have in Firefox. It is exhausting and time consuming to try to work all this out everytime you buy new software, make a software change or just use your computer. I no longer know what to do so am giving it up and hope they both just keep running and no crashes but would welcome less errors, etc.</p>

	<p>If anyone has had any of these issues and the problem lies with me, just tell me, I am happy to resolve it even if this is something stupid I did or do not know. I use Windows Vista Home Premium and connect with <span class="caps">DSL</span>, or with laptop wireless connection is used.</p>
