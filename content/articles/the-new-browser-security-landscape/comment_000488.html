	<p>According to this document you have to use a specific command line switch (&#8212;safe-plugins) in order to enable sandboxing for plug-ins. It also matches what I&#8217;ve read at the Chromium newsgroup a couple of months ago where this very issue was discussed with a concerned user. If my memory doesn&#8217;t fail me plug-ins are problematic to properly sandbox because they all have their own software stack for OS level access (e.g. networking) and Google could not until now not eliminate all incompatibilities.</p>
