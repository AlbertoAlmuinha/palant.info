<p>@Wladimirâ€™s reply to #8:</p>

	<p>I just used the Java Control Panel Update to update from Java 6u17 to 6u18.  It offered me the Yahoo Toolbar, and permission for it to be installed was checked by default.  Same as last time.  It should at least be unchecked by default.</p>

	<p>If I recall correctly, I clicked only once or twice during the install.  One of those times to uncheck Yahoo Toolbar and click Next.  So no, the updates aren&#8217;t fully automatic yet.  They have to at least give you a chance to uncheck the Yahoo Toolbar, otherwise Sun has no plausible deniability. :)</p>
