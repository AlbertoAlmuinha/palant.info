<p>That&#8217;s <span class="caps">AMO</span> source code, not the add-ons. You probably meant http://mxr-test.konigsberg.mozilla.org/addons/ but it is only available to &#8220;the chosen ones&#8221;. In general, my understanding is that <span class="caps">AMO</span> doesn&#8217;t want to make it too easy to search for vulnerable add-ons.</p>

	<p>Either way, I didn&#8217;t want to look at all the add-ons, there are simply too many. I wanted to look only at the popular ones.</p>
