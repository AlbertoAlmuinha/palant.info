	<p>In regards to Wladimir&#8217;s reply to comment 1:  It isn&#8217;t a matter of not wanting to make it easy to search, it&#8217;s just a matter of time and priorities.  As a rule we don&#8217;t consider difficult things inherently secure. :)</p>

	<p>Also, thanks for doing this audit and filing bugs &#8211; it&#8217;s a big help to us and it sets a good example for add-on authors that sample other peoples&#8217; code.</p>
