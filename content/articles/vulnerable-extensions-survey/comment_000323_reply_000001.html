<p><span class="caps">RSS</span> reader extensions are notoriously insecure, I am not aware of any that would do a complete job isolating blog content (though of course some fail in worse ways than others). I can only recommend using the built-in <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader in Thunderbird which has some quirks but works pretty well and has very good security.</p>
