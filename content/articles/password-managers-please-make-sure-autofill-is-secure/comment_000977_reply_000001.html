<p><blockquote>To be honest, I don&#8217;t go on blogspot enough to see the problem with this. I&#8217;d think that either you&#8217;d <strong>want</strong> to share passwords between them because you&#8217;re using the same account to comment on all blogspot blogs or it&#8217;s irrelevant if the login flow redirects you to a different domain.</blockquote></p>

<p>Commenting on Blogspot is isolated within an iframe pointing to blogger.com, the blog itself cannot access it. There is a reason for this: these subdomains are no longer controlled by Blogspot, they are controlled by whoever owns the blog. The blog owner can run arbitrary JavaScript code on them for example. They can also add a login form, if they decide to add authenticated functionality of their own, and that login form will point to whatever backend they like. So if you are registered on foo.blogspot.com, you certainly don&#8217;t want bar.blogspot.com to be able to access these credentials. I&#8217;ve seen a password manager going as far as extending the Public Suffix List to treat blogspot.com, blogspot.de and the like as a public suffix &#8211; so the actual “domain name” would be one level below it. They had similar special casing for lots of other domains as well, mostly also blog hosters. That&#8217;s certainly one way of solving this issue, though one always has to wonder just how complete their list is.</p>

<p>Yes, I mentioned that issue to Mozilla staff on a number of occasions, also written <a href="https://palant.de/2017/11/11/on-web-extensions-shortcomings-and-their-impact-on-add-on-security" rel="nofollow">https://palant.de/2017/11/11/on-web-extensions-shortcomings-and-their-impact-on-add-on-security</a> on it. Unfortunately, nothing is happening from what I know. The current design is pushing extension developers into adopting problematic approaches.</p>
