<p>    “To give you a real example, foo.blogspot.com and bar.blogspot.com are two blogs owned by different people, and you certainly don’t want to share passwords between them.”</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t go on blogspot enough to see the problem with this. I&#8217;d think that either you&#8217;d <strong>want</strong> to share passwords between them because you&#8217;re using the same account to comment on all blogspot blogs or it&#8217;s irrelevant if the login flow redirects you to a different domain.</p>

<p>    “Require a user action for AutoFill”</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve often wondered whether any websites might be using the automatic auto-fill for Firefox&#8217;s built-in password manager to identify non-logged-in users.</p>

<p>    “This is only a partial solution unfortunately as it will not prevent clickjacking attacks. Also, the website can always remove your frame or replace it by its own. So asking users to enter their master password in this frame is a very bad idea: users won’t know whether the frame really belongs to your extension or has been faked by the website.”</p>

<p>Definitely something that Mozilla needs to improve on, given that there&#8217;s no officially-blessed <span class="caps">API</span> for privileged popups that works in all circumstances and the recommended “open a new window” approach doesn&#8217;t really work for people like me who aggressively disable the opening of new windows/tabs without user input and uninstall extensions which manage to circumvent that as part of a frequently used feature.</p>

<p>(Not to mention, depending on the destop window manager in question, opening a new window may not behave as Firefox expects. For example, there&#8217;s a reason that people with tiling window managers either use <span class="caps">GIMP</span> in single-window mode or drop by their WM&#8217;s wiki to grab a complex custom ruleset for <span class="caps">GIMP</span>.)</p>
