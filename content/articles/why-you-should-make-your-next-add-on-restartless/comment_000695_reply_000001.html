<p>Yes, at the moment some things require more work than necessary and aren&#8217;t good enough for newbies. But we are mostly talking about relatively simple code that is easily generalized. I do hope of course that this code becomes part of the platform in future (e.g. component registration for restartless extensions can be easily made part of <span class="caps">XPCOMU</span>tils).</p>
