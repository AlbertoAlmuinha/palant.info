	<p>I followed all your blog posts about &#8220;restartless extensions&#8221; and for me it definitively seems to be a bad idea to do this.</p>

	<p>Many things have to be done in own code, that would be handled by the backend code, otherwise, like overlay loading, component registration and many more.</p>

	<p>In my opinion, Mozilla addon development already has a very steep learning curve, but with restartless, it gets even steeper.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll keep my addon (PrefBar) the way it is until the whole process of porting to &#8220;restartless&#8221; gets simplified a lot. In my opinion, the whole restartless thing is primarily optimized to be used with &#8220;Jetpack&#8221; and not to be used by the average addon developer.</p>
