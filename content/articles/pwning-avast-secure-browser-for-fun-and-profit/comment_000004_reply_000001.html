<p>The issue I wrote about here is fixed. The spying functionality should also be gone now, I didn't verify it though. As to whether the browser is secure now - I have no idea. These eleven extensions are still there and as I mentioned I didn't finish reviewing them.</p>
<p>In general, these extensions are mostly adding attack surface. Their functionality is useless at best, occasionally harmful. I don't see any reason to use this "secure" browser over regular Chrome.</p>
