<p>The existence of vulnerabilities isn't surprising in itself - modern antiviruses are complex beasts, and there is a high pressure to deliver more features that will set them apart from the competition. The main concern is that security is sometimes being so obviously neglected like it happened here. The reason IMHO: security is a cost factor, and there is currently little incentive to invest into it consistently. In particular, security researchers rarely look into the "web protection" component of modern antiviruses, so there is little potential for PR damage here.</p>
