<p>Fabrice has added support for Opera and ie9, and an easy way to upload &#8220;C&#8221; source programs. <br />
==&gt; We can easily compare the performance of each browser :<br />
1- paste some C program in the clipboard aera
   (just use #include &lt;tcclib.h&gt; instead of usual ones)<br />
2- type &#8220;cat /dev/clipboard &gt;toto.c;tcc -run toto.c&#8221;<br />
3- measure start time &#8211; end time </p>

	<p>On a mandelbrot test :<br />
-ie9 is 10% slower than firefox,<br />
-both are very slow (probably due to the lack of &#8220;fpu&#8221;).</p>
