	<p>I haven&#8217;t seen it mentioned on Planet yet, could it be that nobody heard? I&#8217;ve seen lots of cool browser demos lately but this one really blows me away: <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/">jslinux by Fabrice Bellard</a>. This is a real x86 emulator written in JavaScript and running Linux, not a fake Linux terminal. The emulated hardware is somewhat limited (e.g. <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/tech.html">no <span class="caps">FPU</span></a>) but this doesn&#8217;t make packing an emulator into less than 20 kB of JavaScript code less impressive. The emulator loads a bunch of binary Linux images and&nbsp;&mdash; voil√†, Linux boots up.</p>

	<p>It is also really fast, booting up takes 7 seconds in Firefox 4 for me, and all the other operations don&#8217;t take much longer than they would on a real system. Supposedly, Chrome 11 is also supported but for me it hangs up near the end of the boot process. Also, Chrome 11 is noticeably slower (Fabrice Bellard himself made this observation as well). There are plenty of command line tools available, including a compiler. I first had my doubts&nbsp;&mdash; but they all work as you expect them to. I can even ping 127.0.0.1 (pinging other addresses or using wget fails because the emulated hardware lacks a network interface). <strong>Update</strong>: Even better: run <code>telnetd</code>, change root password with <code>passwd</code>, then telnet to 127.0.0.1 and log in as root&nbsp;&mdash; it actually works.</p>
