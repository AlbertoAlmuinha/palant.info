<p><span class="caps">HTTPS</span> Everywhere is a very complex extension. It has a rules file that is larger than 1 MB in size, apparently it lists every website on the web known to have working <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> support. If you want to add one more site you need to learn how to write their rules (recommendation from <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> Everywhere <span class="caps">FAQ</span>). It will listen to all your connections and not only rewrite them to use <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> but also change cookies to ensure these are never sent over unencrypted connections. It has the <span class="caps">SSL</span> Observatory feature which is nice for people who know what it is about but scary for everybody else (meaning the majority of them).</p>

	<p>Enforce Encryption on the other hand is simply about giving you a tool to enforce <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> connections on the websites you are using &#8211; and it doesn&#8217;t even implement this feature, it rather activates a built-in Firefox feature for you. You decide where and how you want to use it, there is no predefined list. The extension is tiny and very lightweight, the configuration interface minimal and unobtrusive.</p>

	<p>Which one you should use depends on your requirements of course.</p>
