	<p>You sorted for a job Wladimir? I was sorta hoping we might get Interclue funded in time to ask you if you wanted to join the fun, but we took quite a while just to launch the thing. Still, who knows, now that we&#8217;re finally &#8220;out there&#8221; anything could happen. Regardless, if you&#8217;ve got a free moment download the <span class="caps">XPI</span> from interclue.com &#8211; I&#8217;m just working on getting it into the <span class="caps">AMO</span> Sandbox&#8230;and a dozen other things&#8230;</p>
