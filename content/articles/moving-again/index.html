<p>I am finished here in Oslo, so I will move to Cologne next week. In some way I feel sad about it, I really liked Oslo. On the other hand, I will finally be in the same country as everybody I care about, it has been too long. Anyway, goodbye Norway and welcome Germany!</p>

	<p>On a related note, it seems that I won&#8217;t have internet access the next week. My internet provider wanted to get rid of me so much that it decided to disconnect me one week before the date I asked.</p>
