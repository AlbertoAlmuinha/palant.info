<p>Hi - I've done typical copy-paste from your article :) index is generating, I have search input and everything on the place. But... end with no results in this message in console: Uncaught TypeError: target is null</p>
<p>Pointing at this line of code:     while (target.firstChild)</p>
<p>Any ideas? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
