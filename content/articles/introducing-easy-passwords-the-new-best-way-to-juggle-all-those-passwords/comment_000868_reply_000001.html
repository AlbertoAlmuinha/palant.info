<p>If I were to implement this, I wouldn&#8217;t turn this into a plugin script but rather connect the two extensions. This way you would still be able to manage your passwords via Easy Passwords UI. Ideally, Easy Passwords would add a few commands to ChatZilla &#8211; register a nick, change password for an already registered nick, identify.</p>

	<p>However, I&#8217;m not sure what a future-proof way of doing this would look like. Easy Passwords has been written in such a way that converting it to Web Extensions should be relatively easy. But once this is done it won&#8217;t have any way of messing with ChatZilla.</p>
