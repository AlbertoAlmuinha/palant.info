	<p>My only problem with generated passwords. Is sometimes I need to log in to a service when I&#8217;m not near my computer. I only use a desktop. If I have to login from somewhere else, like my brothers iPhone or something, I can&#8217;t. The other day I was at my uncles and wanted to log in to my phone service (I use an online one) but couldn&#8217;t remember the password.</p>

	<p>These incidents are one off though. So I&#8217;m giving this a shot! Thanks for this read!</p>
