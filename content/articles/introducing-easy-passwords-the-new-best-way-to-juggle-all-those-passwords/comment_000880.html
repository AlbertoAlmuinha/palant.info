	<p>I&#8217;m using Password Hasher for the moment but, as you pointed out in your survey, it&#8217;s very outdated and insecure. I would like to give EasyPasswords a try. The thing is, I switched from Firefox to Pale Moon several months ago because of the changes in Firefox that keep breaking some of my favorite addons. And also UI changes that I don&#8217;t like and added functionality like WebRTC or Pocket which I have no interest in. Anyway, EasyPasswords doesn&#8217;t support Firefox versions prior to 41 and therefore also not Pale Moon. Would it be too difficult to support it? I would be willing to invest some time in this but I have little to no knowledge about Firefox addon development.</p>
