	<p>would you publish the code for https://palant.de/easypasswords-online.html so that anyone could install it on its own server rather than entering its mater password on an unknown siteÂ ?<br />
Ideally (it depends on the languages you used), I could transport it on my usb key with some kind of stand-alone server (or better as a self served page if it is possible).<br />
Thanks</p>
