	<p>You&#8217;re right, the online page doesn&#8217;t work because of lacking WebCrypto support. When I checked the Pale Moon discussion forum I read that it&#8217;s not supported not because it&#8217;s fancy new stuff but because crypto in browser is inherently insecure. I&#8217;m not knowledgable enough to discuss this technically but the chances of me going back to Firefox is pretty slim, so I&#8217;ll look at other solutions like SpiderOak Encryptr. Thanks.</p>
