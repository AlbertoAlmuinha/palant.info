<p>There you go: <a href="https://palant.de/2016/04/20/security-considerations-for-password-generators#overview" rel="nofollow">https://palant.de/2016/04/20/security-considerations-for-password-generators#overview</a>. The list has been somewhat updated, hash0 still comes out top however. UniquePasswordBuilder and masterpassword aren&#8217;t great but ok to be used <span class="caps">IMHO</span>. Everything else on that list isn&#8217;t recommendable.</p>
