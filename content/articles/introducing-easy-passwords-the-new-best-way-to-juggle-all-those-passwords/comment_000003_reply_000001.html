<p>Thank you for pointing me to this add-on, I overlooked it back when I did my survey of password generators.</p>

	<p>Well, for one this extension is ancient and hasn&#8217;t really been updated much, so it isn&#8217;t restartless for example. It has no user interface, meaning no website aliasing functionality like I mentioned in my blog post &#8211; it guesses the relevant part of the domain name, and if the guess is wrong you are stuck. It also won&#8217;t remember what passwords you generated, so it is up to you to remember which websites you use generated passwords on. Only one password per site is possible, and if the generated password fails to meet site&#8217;s criteria you are stuck. In other words, it fails to provide an answer to any of the issues I raised in this blog post.</p>

	<p>Oh, and it is one of those password generators that messed up crypto. You shouldn&#8217;t use it, it simply isn&#8217;t safe. I&#8217;ll publish a blog post on security considerations for passwords generators soon.</p>
