	<p>Hi</p>

	<p>Does EasyPassword use the Firefox built-in system? Or you store all in a separate database? I&#8217;m looking for an improvement in password management since long time, but still I can&#8217;t find what I need. Your extension seems interesting but with some limits too.</p>

	<p>And, above all, why don&#8217;t work on the native pasword manager instead of an extension? In that way all users can benefit from your work by default, and a sync platform is available for people who need it.</p>
