<p>“The password system is broken” &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how often I&#8217;ve heard that phrase already. Yes, passwords suck. Nobody can be expected to remember passwords for dozens of websites. Websites enforcing arbitrary complexity rules (“between 5 and 7 characters, containing at least two-upper case letters and a dog&#8217;s name”) doesn&#8217;t make it any better. So far I&#8217;ve heard of three common strategies to deal with passwords: write them down, use the same one everywhere or just hit “forgot password” every time you access the website. None of these are particularly secure or recommendable, and <span class="caps">IMHO</span> neither are the suggestions to derive passwords via more or less complicated manual algorithms.</p>

<p>As none of the password killing solutions gained significant traction so far, password managers still seem to be the best choice for now. However, these often have the disadvantage of relying on a third-party service which you have to trust or storing your passwords on disk so that you have to trust their crypto. But there is also this ancient idea to derive individual passwords from a single master password via one-way hashing functions. This is great as the only sensitive piece of data is your master password, and this one you can hopefully just remember.</p>

<p>Now all the existing password generators have significant usability issues. What if I want to have multiple passwords on a single website? What if different websites share the same login credentials (e.g. all the WordPress blogs)? What if you are required to change your password every few months? What if there is some password which I have to use as is rather than replace it by a generated one? How to deal with that crazy website that doesn&#8217;t accept special characters in passwords? Do I have to remember all the websites that I generated passwords for? I haven&#8217;t found any solution that would answer all these questions. And I&#8217;m not even starting about security, this is a topic for a separate blog post (spoiler: only one out of twenty password generator extensions for Firefox got crypto right).</p>

<p>So last summer I decided to roll my own: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/easy-passwords/">Easy Passwords</a>. I&#8217;m working on it in my spare time so it took a while until I considered it ready for general use but now you can finally go and install it. You set your master password and then you can generate named passwords for any website. You can adjust password length and character set to match the requirements of the website. And if the generated password absolutely won&#8217;t do, you can still store your existing password&nbsp;&mdash; it will be encrypted securely, only to be decrypted with your master password.</p>

<p>On most websites your password can be filled in with a single click. And Easy Passwords supports website aliases: for some WordPress blog you can edit the site name into “wordpress.com”&nbsp;&mdash; done, you will get WordPress passwords there now. And it can show you all your passwords on a single page, you can even print them as a paper backup. This piece of paper has enough information to recreate all your passwords should your hard drive crash, but it will be useless to anybody who doesn&#8217;t know your master password.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not perfect of course. For example, the aliasing functionality isn&#8217;t very intuitive and could be improved. I also have a few <a href="https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues">issues listed in the GitHub project</a>, e.g. I&#8217;d like to warn about filling in passwords if the website doesn&#8217;t use <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>. Also, a secure master password is very important so it would be nice to implement some kind of security indicator when the master password is set. I wonder what other issues people come up with, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
