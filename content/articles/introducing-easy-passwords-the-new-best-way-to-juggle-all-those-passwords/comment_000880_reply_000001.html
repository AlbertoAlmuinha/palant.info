<p>Feel free to try the online version under <a href="https://palant.github.io/easypasswords/online.html" rel="nofollow">https://palant.github.io/easypasswords/online.html</a> &#8211; I bet that it doesn&#8217;t work in Pale Moon, meaning that supporting Pale Moon isn&#8217;t feasible. Problem is that Pale Moon uses an extremely outdated version of Gecko which the developers enrich with hand-selected changes (yes, they forked Gecko without having the resources to maintain it properly). The way I&#8217;ve seen it, they won&#8217;t have any interest in that &#8220;fancy new stuff&#8221; like WebCrypto <span class="caps">API</span> (similarly to how they&#8217;ve disabled lots of forward-facing stuff, like WebRTC).</p>
