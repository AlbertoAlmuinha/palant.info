<p>Because in case of &#8220;object tabs&#8221; chrome code calls addBinding &#8211; so the principle checked is a chrome principle and not the principle of the document where the binding is loaded. If you would use -moz-binding <span class="caps">CSS</span> property instead of addBinding, that would break with the new restrictions of course.</p>
