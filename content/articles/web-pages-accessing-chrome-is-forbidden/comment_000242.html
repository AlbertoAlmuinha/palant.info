	<p>Dear Mr. Taylor, I too &#8220;looked to see how this is being used in the wild&#8221; </p>

	<p>javascript +&#8220;chrome://&#8221;                  <br />
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=javascript+%2B%22chrome%3A%2F%2F%22</p>

	<p>and immediately found, upon <span class="caps">PAGE</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> of the search results, an example which demonstrates exploitation of the chrome vulnerability. I&#8217;m suspect the script kiddies are happily putting this to use.</p>
