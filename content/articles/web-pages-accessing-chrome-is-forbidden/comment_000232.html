<p>Just out of interest, I had a look at how chrome:// seems to be used in the wild. Out of about 130K of the pages listed on dmoz.org, I found:</p>

	<p>http://www.hypno-analysis.co.uk/ and http://www.treesculptor.co.uk and http://www.stjohnsgerman.com (a few months ago, now changed) &#8211; chrome://editor/content/images/tag-comment.gif (which seems to come from Nvu, along with the quite bogus &lt;comment&gt; element)</p>

	<p>http://www.laurencejgillis.com/ and http://www.kleinbahnsammler.at/ and http://www.sdw.pl/ &#8211; chrome://skype_ff_toolbar_win/content/inactive_ln.gif and some similar others</p>

	<p>http://www.psychotherapy.ro and http://www.uwm.edu.pl &#8211; chrome://piclens/content/launch.png</p>

	<p>http://orangeloop.bravehost.com &#8211; chrome://searchstatus/skin/nofollow.css</p>

	<p>http://www.bienen-partner.de &#8211; chrome://noscript/skin/icon32.png</p>

	<p>http://mendocinohotel.com &#8211; chrome://informenter/skin/marker.png</p>

	<p>(These all look like mistakes to me, rather than attempts to actually do anything useful with chrome://)</p>
