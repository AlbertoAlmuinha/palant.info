	<p>I use noscript not for all-consuming protection against a directed attack against me, but for protection from accidental visiting of malicious websites, and annoying ad-sites(which may dump adware on your computer, often operating from white-listed sites). </p>

	<p>If i visit a thought-to-be safe website and it turns out it is not a safe website, NoScript protects me and prevents the bad scripts from running. These kinds of websites are not directly attacking me, trying to circumvent my NoScript or anything, but simply trying to dump whatever they can on whoever comes across their website.</p>
