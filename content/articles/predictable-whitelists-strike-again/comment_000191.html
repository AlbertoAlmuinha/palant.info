	<p>Wladimir,</p>

	<p>I think you are wrong here. This attack didn&#8217;t have anything to do with RSnake&#8217;s whitelisting his website in Noscript. RSnake himself mentioned a &#8220;vuln in NoScript&#8221; (which has been fixed in the meanwhile). Whitelisting wasn&#8217;t the culprit as &#8220;since version 1.1.4.9 NoScript checks also requests started from whitelisted origins for specific suspicious <span class="caps">URL</span> patterns landing on other trusted sites: if a potential <span class="caps">XSS</span> attack is detected, even if coming from a trusted source, filters are promptly triggered&#8221; (quotze the Noscript site).</p>
