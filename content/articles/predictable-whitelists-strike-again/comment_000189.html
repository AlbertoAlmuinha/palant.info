<p>The bit about whitelisting googlesyndication.com reminds me of something <a href="http://www.blakeross.com" rel="nofollow" >Blake Ross</a> wrote:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you heard the one about how [Netscape] whitelisted themselves? This is one of my favorite anecdotes, and though my memory is fuzzy about the exact timeline and versions involved, it goes something like this: Mozilla implements popup blocking and releases a milestone to great acclaim. Netscape soon follows with its own release based on the Mozilla offering. Because Netscape is Mozilla at its core, the press is naturally expecting it to have popup blocking. It doesn’t, because—lo and behold—some AOL/Netscape web properties use popup ads, and heaven forbid those get blocked! After a thorough public lashing, Netscape goes back to the drawing board and finally puts out a release that blocks popups. The catch: a whitelist, buried in preferences and thus out of reach of most users, that permits <span class="caps">AOL</span> web properties to continue opening popup ads. One of these properties just so happened to be Netscape.com.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Guess what the browser’s default homepage was.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The user started up his shiny new browser—<span class="caps">NOW</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">POPUP</span> BLOCKING!—and got a popup ad.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Netscape isn’t doing too well these days.&#8221; </p>
