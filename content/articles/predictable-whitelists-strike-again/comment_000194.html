<p>&#8220;The quality of the <span class="caps">XSS</span> protection isn&#8217;t good enough&#8221;? Well, first of all, Sirdarckcat and kuza55 needed several weeks to find out, by combining 3 weaknesses (one of them specific to ha.ckers.org), how to bypass Noscript &#8211; so it doesn&#8217;t seem to be that easy. And while Giorgio himself surely wouldn&#8217;t rule out any loopholes in Noscript&#8217;s anti-<span class="caps">XSS</span> code, it&#8217;s remarkable that none of these hundreds or thousands obfuscated <span class="caps">XSS</span> vectors posted on sla.ckers.org were able to bypass it. </p>

	<p>But if you really think that it&#8217;s not good enough, why don&#8217;t you prove it by posting your results in http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?12,17238  ?</p>
