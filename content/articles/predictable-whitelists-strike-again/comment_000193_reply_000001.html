<p>I was referring to the way Giorgio &#8220;fixed&#8221; the issue of predictable whitelists. Instead of actually fixing it he created an even bigger issue. Now NoScript is relying heavily on the quality of its <span class="caps">XSS</span> protection &#8211; a hole in this protection brings back the old whitelists issue and makes NoScript useless. And since the quality of the <span class="caps">XSS</span> protection isn&#8217;t good enough (cannot be good enough), a somewhat determined attacker can still abuse predictable whitelists. And I simply don&#8217;t think that something that relies on the attacker being stupid can be called a security solution (stupid attackers usually aren&#8217;t dangerous anyway).</p>
