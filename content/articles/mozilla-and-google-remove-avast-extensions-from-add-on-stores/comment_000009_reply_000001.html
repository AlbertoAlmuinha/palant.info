<p>That's a weird logic. Of course, if there are hundreds of parties stealing and exchanging our data, then Google, Facebook and Amazon will loose an advantage. But is that the world that you want to strive for? Is it really the ideal scenario for us as consumers? Wouldn't it rather make more sense to restrict Google &amp; Co. in what data they can collect and how they can use it?</p>
<p>As to Avast terms of service - sure, it's your choice if you want to rely on those to protect you. But terms of service generally exist to protect the company, not consumers. And Avast was already caught collecting and selling users' data without informing them. They went as far as to show a consent screen for the data collection in the antivirus application (not explaining that they turn data into profit of course), then ignoring the result in the browser extensions despite respecting some other antivirus settings. Now they are defending themselves with claims that are provably incorrect, e.g. talking about Mozilla changing add-on policies and delisting them on short notice when the policy in question is many years old.</p>
<p>So: yes, you can choose to trust Avast. But please don't expect other people to follow you there.</p>
