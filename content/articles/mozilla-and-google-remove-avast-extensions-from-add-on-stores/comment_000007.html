<p>Thanks for highlighting this. Avast are indeed collecting this data and re-selling it via Jumpshot, but they claim they have users consent to do this and that’s why they can to re-sell it. I’ve seen this data and it is incredibly granular. Data fields include a timestamp (to “millisecond precision”) as well as device ID, browser type and platform, full URL (which occasionally includes information like postcode, car registration, phone number etc), details of any searches undertaken while on that URL and derived location (from the IP). URLs can include visits to health websites, porn viewing etc. Everything that browser has looked at or searched for online. This data is sold to 3rd parties.</p>
