<p>I use the Avast client but not any of the browser extensions and I've had my suspicions for a while that the antivirus client is also doing things with URL's you visit. For example if you visit an adult site it will popup an advert for their VPN service. Not every time mind you but often enough to not be a coincidence.</p>
