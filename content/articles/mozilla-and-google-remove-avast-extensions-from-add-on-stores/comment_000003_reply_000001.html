<p>Yes, I've seen their statements, and I wonder what their accepted solution is going to look like. Also whether they update the Chrome extension given that Google doesn't seem interested in taking action.</p>
<p>That said, these statements aren't true of course. First of all, Mozilla's policies haven't seen any changes in years that would have been relevant here. Second, they collect far more data than necessary for the functionality and they know it. I've looked at Microsoft's Windows Defender Browser Protection browser extension today, that one only sends the hostname and path, no parameters and no context information. Microsoft also has a problematic instanceID parameter, but at least that one changes daily - it's not a persistent user identifier. Never mind having the exact same functionality in a shopping helper.</p>
<p>But what else would one expect? Avast has already been caught four years ago, yet they somehow got away with claiming that they fixed the issue and simply continuing.</p>
