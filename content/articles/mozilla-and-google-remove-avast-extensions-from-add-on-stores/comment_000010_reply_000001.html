<p>That most recent policy update only affects extensions using obfuscated code, presumably it has nothing with the Avast situation. The relevant update is rather <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/03/05/updates-add-review-policies/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/03/05/updates-add-review-policies/</a> which is mentioning data collection, that's April 2018. But even that update was a mere clarification, that policy existed in a somewhat different form for almost as long as addons.mozilla.org itself.</p>
<p>extensionworkshop.com is a very new website, you have to look up https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Agreement in the Wayback Machine. For example, the 2015 version says: "Add-ons must not: make any unexpected features that can be privacy or security-sensitive strictly opt-in" (yes, the formulation is suboptimal but the meaning is clear nevertheless).</p>
