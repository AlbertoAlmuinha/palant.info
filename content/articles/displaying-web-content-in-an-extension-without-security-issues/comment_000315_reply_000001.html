<p>I think you are misunderstanding something, minor releases aren&#8217;t supposed to change <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> interfaces &#8211; as it is now, the Mozilla project tends to consider all the <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> interfaces, frozen or not, as &#8220;the <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221;. Of course the interface could change between major releases, but then again &#8211; everything can change between major releases, and extension developers usually have to worry about browser UI changes far more than about incompatible <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> interface changes.</p>
