<p>Ooops, sorry for forgetting about this.</p>

	<p>A minor release <em>did</em> change an interface in 3.0.2.  And caused people with that extension to crash.  And people were all blaming the extension for using an internal interface.  See bug 455283 (RoboForm, nsIFrame).  Granted, that&#8217;s more likely to change than docshell; but I was told docshell will never be frozen anyway, too, so it&#8217;s also free to blow up.</p>

	<p>Unless an interface is explcitly marked frozen, it probably <em>will</em> blow up.</p>

	<p>Talking about things from (somebody else&#8217;s) experience sucks.</p>
