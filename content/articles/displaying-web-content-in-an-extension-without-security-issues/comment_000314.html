	<p>I&#8217;ve had a problem before where the <span class="caps">MDC</span> <span class="caps">XUL</span> documentation for iframe doesn&#8217;t seem to mention the type attribute, but for browser it does. And not that many people know whether it does follow the type attribute. Thanks for bringing this up.</p>
