<p>Awesome, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@WPalant" rel="nofollow">@WPalant@infosec.exchange</a> is giving Webmentions a try and that’s totally not my fault 😁</p>
<p>Hope this works out for you too 👍 It’s intriguing how your focus is on the security side of things. Most people I know use it simply for easier interactions and backfeeding. Let me know if you’re interested in a tour/demo 😉</p>
