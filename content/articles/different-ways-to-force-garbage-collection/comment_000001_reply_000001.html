<p>Don&#8217;t ask me, I am only quoting an <span class="caps">IDL</span> comment, I know very little about cycle collector internals. My guess: cycle collector cannot collect some nodes in the first pass because it looks like they are still in use. But it will collect the nodes that are using them. So the remaining nodes will require a second cycle collector pass before they are collected &#8211; which is usually not a problem, the cycle collector runs every now and then and a node collected a minute later is ok. It is only a problem when you want to observe the &#8220;final result&#8221; of the cycle collector. Another question: are two passes always sufficient? Probably not but should be &#8220;good enough&#8221; in most situations.</p>
