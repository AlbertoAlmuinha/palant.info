<p>Remove all topics from <span class="caps">MDN</span> that should be covered by docs.webplatform.org .</p>

	<p>Write less on <span class="caps">MDN</span>. That is, many pages that should contain reference information have been drowned in prose and wiki-layout making them slow to use. As opposed to e.g. w3school (which some Mozillians love to hate) that give the needed info upfront (and load over 4 times faster &#8212; in a test I just ran with webpagetest.org) or caniuse.com .</p>
