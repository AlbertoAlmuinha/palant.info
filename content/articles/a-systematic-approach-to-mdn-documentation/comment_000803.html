<p>So&#8230; there&#8217;s a lot right here. Unfortunately, the small <span class="caps">MDN</span> team can only do so much, and given that open Web developers vastly outnumber add-on developers, and the current emphasis on apps and Firefox OS, most of our time goes there, and the <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> and other add-on related content has fallen badly out of date.</p>

	<p>We are working on an answer for this problem, but it&#8217;s probably not going to involve the docs suddenly becoming up-to-date. We&#8217;re likely to have to rely heavily on the engineering teams and community members to do much of this work. Ideally, we&#8217;d come up with plans and guidelines, and then set people to it, but the details have to be hashed out, and we&#8217;ll need input from engineers and add-on developers to make even a plan happen.</p>

	<p>When we&#8217;re ready to make a move on this, we&#8217;ll post to the relevant lists. For now, we do have some minor work being done to address a couple of specific problems that have been recognized as pain points, but this is a very limited effort.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m very much an &#8220;if it&#8217;s not all fully documented, the docs aren&#8217;t right&#8221; kind of guy, so having this stuff in this condition is a gnawing pain for me. I&#8217;m eager to find an answer. We&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p>
