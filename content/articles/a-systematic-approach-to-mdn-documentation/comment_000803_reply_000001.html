<p>Eric, let me take this opportunity to thank you for your great work. I&#8217;m certainly not expecting things to improve overnight &#8211; it took a while for the documentation to get into the current bad shape, it will take a while to get out of it again. <span class="caps">MDN</span> content is just too massive for anything to happen quickly. All I can hope for is a plan. So I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting your announcements.</p>
