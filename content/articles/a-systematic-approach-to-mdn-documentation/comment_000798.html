<p>Well, it&#8217;s definitely not a problem that&#8217;s unique to <span class="caps">MDN</span>&#8230; the internet is full of misleadingly-obsolete information, technical recommendations that were good practice in 2004 but ten years later, are dangerously bad ideas. And it&#8217;s really not much better in the commercial closed-source world&#8230; the company I work for has tons of documentation on different processes and components of our product &#8211; but because nobody really owns all that documentation, it tends to be poorly maintained&#8230; one of the experts might fix it up if they find something wrong, but they don&#8217;t really have time to do anything systematic.</p>

	<p>The best I can offer is that it has to be dealt with as part of the development process. Preferably, that means that the developer takes responsibility for actually fixing documentation that&#8217;s obsoleted by their changes &#8211; but failing that, the developer should at least have some mechanism (and responsibility) for finding and flagging documentation that needs reviewing or rework, and some way to find such documents&#8230; treat it the same way you would treat a functional bug.</p>
