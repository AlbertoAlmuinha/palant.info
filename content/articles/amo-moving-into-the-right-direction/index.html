	<p>Thanks to <a href="http://morgamic.com/">morgamic</a> for telling me this, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have noticed otherwise&nbsp;&mdash; Addons.Mozilla.Org has made an important move towards raising the quality bar. The autogenerated spyware-infested Conduit-based toolbars have been disabled, <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2691999#2691999">all 93 of them</a>. Any new submissions will be automatically rejected. Way to go, AMO!</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Shortly, all Conduit-based toolbars on the Mozilla Add-ons site (addons.mozilla.org) will be disabled, as Mozilla has determined that they are not appropriate for hosting on <span class="caps">AMO</span>.  Authors of existing add-ons will receive email notifications of the disabling, and future submissions of Conduit will be denied by our reviewers.</p>

	<p>Thanks, Mike! That&#8217;s 93 security holes less.</p>
