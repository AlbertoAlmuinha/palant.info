<p>I checked out soonerscoop toolbar to verify &#8211; the backdoor is still there and allows any website to execute code with user&#8217;s privileges. I reported that issue to Conduit and got a mail from Dror Erez asking for details &#8211; I replied it on 14 Jun 2007 16:33:53 +0200 with a testcase. That testcase still works, it checks the cookies the user has in his browser (it could do far more of course), so I don&#8217;t feel comfortable publishing it.</p>
