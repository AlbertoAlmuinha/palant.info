	<p>We just ran into that last comment and checked up on the &#8216;pref(“security.xpconnect.activex.global.hosting_fl ags”, 9)&#8217; issue. </p>

	<p>This is what we discovered: <br />
The code in the file &#8220;active.js&#8221; is not executed, because the &#8216;pref&#8217; function is not defined. <br />
That file was removed from version 1.5.40.0 and up, since it was not in use.</p>

	<p>What &#8220;huge backdoor that I reported&#8221; are you referring to?</p>

	<p>This is a very serious allegation since it is of the utmost importance for us to make sure that our toolbars are safe to install and use (our business depends on it). If you know of any existing problem please let us about it <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p>
