	<p>You call that moving in the right direction?<br />
I don&#8217;t personally use Conduit as an author but I have installed a few of their toolbars. If you dig a bit deeper into the issues you&#8217;ll see that Conduit <span class="caps">DOES</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> include spyware. The toolbar does send anonymous usage statistics (check with a network sniffer) but many applications do nowadays and most modern websites collection much more information about you than a Conduit toolbar. Any site that uses Google Analytics is <span class="caps">MUCH</span> more of an invasion of your privacy than a Conduit toolbar.<br />
With this step Mozilla is starting to behave like they&#8217;re the Internet&#8217;s police officer. The next step will be for them to remove extensions like AdBlock just because it harms their revenues. What ever happened to ecosystems where <span class="caps">USERS</span> determine what they want, not what big brother wants? Who gave Mozilla (or Mike Shaver) the right to govern what extensions are good enough for users?<br />
If users do not want to install extensions from Conduit, fine. But if users have chosen to install and use specific extensions (some of the Conduit extensions have received hundreds of thousands of downloads on <span class="caps">AMO</span>) why should Mozilla suddenly determine that these extensions are not good enough?<br />
I&#8217;m personally very worried about this step. How can I now trust Mozilla not to &#8220;hide&#8221; content from me? If Mozilla continues to behave like this how can we be sure that the next step won&#8217;t be for them to block some content from appearing in the browser? Maybe somebody in Mozilla will suddenly decide that adult web sites are not fit for Firefox users and start blocking them automatically?<br />
What Mozilla should have done is create some kind of sandbox where all extensions can be found. Popular extensions in the sandbox (where users determine what&#8217;s popular) will be promoted to the general public. This model has been proven to work on the Internet (it&#8217;s very similar to Digg) and  creates an ecosystem where users can freely access all content without restriction but the general public is only exposed to the cream of the crop (protecting the general public from &#8220;bad&#8221; content).<br />
This step Mozilla has taken should actually make you worry about your freedom on the Internet&#8230;</p>
