<p>There must be some misunderstanding. These extensions are no longer listed on <span class="caps">AMO</span>, that doesn&#8217;t mean that they cannot be promoted anywhere else. There are quite a few extensions that you cannot find on <span class="caps">AMO</span> (like LiveHTTPHeaders or Aardvark) and there are quite a few other resources where you can download Firefox extensions (like The Extensions Mirror). On the other hand, when <span class="caps">AMO</span> provides you the platform to promote your extension, <strong>they set the rules</strong>. You can find it undemocratic but you have to accept this or find yourself another hosting platform. And if <span class="caps">AMO</span> decides that hosting an extension that provides minimal functionality to hide a totally unrelated secondary function is not in the best interest of their users &#8211; it is their full right to remove this extension. After all, <span class="caps">AMO</span> has a responsibility towards their users. You can try to submit a spyware application on download.com or any similar site and you will soon notice that all of them have protection mechanisms in place.</p>

	<p>The important point really is this non-obvious secondary function. Every toolbar is promoted by its features, the spyware function is well-hidden. Therefore it is very much a concern, no matter what data is transmitted &#8211; this extension shouldn&#8217;t transmit any data at all. Download numbers don&#8217;t matter, if you manage to trick users into downloading spyware it doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that spyware is good. Maybe you noticed, there has been a long discussion about whether these toolbars should be allowed on <span class="caps">AMO</span>. For some time the solution has been to require these extensions to show users a privacy policy &#8211; but you should know that most users ignore those, especially the unexperienced users these toolbars are targeted to. So <span class="caps">AMO</span> was finally convinced that this issue needed a better solution (it is in particular Mike Shaver who needed lots of convincing).</p>

	<p>I find this a very important step since users tend to trust anything that is offered on <span class="caps">AMO</span> and so far <a href="/blog/no-good-deed-goes-unpunished" rel="nofollow" ><span class="caps">AMO</span> didn&#8217;t perform too well dealing with this trust</a>. In the article I linked I mentioned security vulnerabilities that I found in many extensions, one of the most interesting finds was a wide open hole in all Conduit toolbars that allowed any web site to easily take over your computer. Given that this vulnerability was very obviously introduced intentionally Conduit will have a hard time explaining it. I hope that this find was one of the reasons for <span class="caps">AMO</span> to finally change their policy.</p>

	<p>And while your analogy with browsing porn sites is deeply flawed, there is something true about it. If one follows your arguments, phishing sites are justified as long as there are users visiting them. Thankfully Mozilla didn&#8217;t agree and phishing protection is now built into Firefox. You can make a stand for phishing sites and against censorship but I think you will be vastly outnumbered.</p>

	<p>By the way, <span class="caps">AMO</span> does in fact plan to improve their review process by introducing a &#8220;sandbox&#8221;: <a href="http://blog.fligtar.com/2006/11/21/reviewing-the-review-process/" rel="nofollow" >http://blog.fligtar.com/2006/11/21/reviewing-the-review-process/</a>. However, there will still be a review necessary before an extension gets into the &#8220;public&#8221; area and one main purpose of this review is to make sure that the extension doesn&#8217;t expose users to any hidden risks. Popularity doesn&#8217;t show it, only few users dissect an extension before installing it.</p>
