	<p>Thanks to your advice, it was fairly easy to change the source code in keyboard.c to produce the desired results. </p>

	<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to get the revised code to appear correctly here, so here is a link to the revised file:</p>

	<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/wa672ngxj6zp9yx/keyboard.c</p>

	<p>The four changed lines have comments that begin &#8220;//was&#8221; etc., etc.</p>

	<p>Thank you again!</p>
