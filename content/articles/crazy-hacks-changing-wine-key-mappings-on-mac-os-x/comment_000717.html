<p>Hello Wladimir,</p>

	<p>Thank you for this! I am putting together a Wineskin wrapper for a <span class="caps">DOS</span> emulator called vDos, and I had to use the X11 driver, because I was able to map (Windows) Alt to (OS X) Option, and Win to Cmd using an .xmodmap file, but I wasn&#8217;t able to map those keys in the Mac driver. However, for many reasons, I wanted to use the Mac driver (which makes it possible to get full-screen mode without a menubar).</p>

	<p>Your instructions made it easy for me to map Alt to the Option keys by patching winemac.drv.so from the current Wine. But I cannot figure out how to map LWin and RWin to LCmd and RCmd. Is there any chance you can help?</p>

	<p>In case it helps anyone else, I&#8217;ve put a copy of my patched winemac.drv.so here:</p>

	<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/e799aofw280gi3a/winemac.drv.so</p>

	<p>I hope someone might find it useful. </p>

	<p>Again, thank you for these clear and valuable instructions.</p>

	<p>P.S. Some years ago I sent a contribution for AdBlock Plus, and it&#8217;s good to be able to thank you again in person.</p>
