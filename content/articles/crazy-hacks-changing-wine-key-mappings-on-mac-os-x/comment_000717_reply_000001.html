<p>In your file the entry for the right command key can be found at hexadecimal offset 63990, left command key is the next entry. I&#8217;m not quite sure about the scan codes for the Windows key but it seems that you have to replace these bytes by:</p>

	<p>5C 00 5C 01 01 00 00 00<br />
5B 00 5B 01 01 00 00 00</p>

	<p>However, I wonder how that is supposed to work &#8211; applications rarely handle the Windows key themselves, it is normally being handled by the operating system (which is missing in case of Wine).</p>
