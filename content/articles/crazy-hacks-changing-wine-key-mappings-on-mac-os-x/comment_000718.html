	<p>That is exactly the answer I was looking for. Thank you again! </p>

	<p>This works because the application I am using (sourceforge.net/projects/vdos) is an <span class="caps">SDL</span> application that defines the Win key for its own purposes. It uses Win-F11/F12 to reduce and enlarge the window, Ctrl-Win-V to paste from the Windows clipboard (in Wine, from the OS X clipboard), and Ctrl-Win-click to start drawing a box that is copied to the clipboard when the mouse button is released.</p>

	<p>I am setting up vDos to work with WordPerfect for <span class="caps">DOS</span>. Thanks to your patch, all the Alt, Ctrl, and Shift keys work as WordPerfect expects, and the Win keys work perfectly also.</p>

	<p>Now I will try to modify the source code so that it produces a file that doesn&#8217;t need to be patched. If you get inspired to post instructions for fixing the source, a lot of people will be grateful. If I figure it out, I will post the details here.</p>

	<p>Also, I&#8217;ve replaced the file that I linked in my earlier message with one that has both of your patches.</p>

	<p>Thank you again!</p>
