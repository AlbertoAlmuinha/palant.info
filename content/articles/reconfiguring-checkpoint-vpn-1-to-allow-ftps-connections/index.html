	<p>I recently tried using <span class="caps">FTPS</span> (<span class="caps">SSL</span>-encrypted <span class="caps">FTP</span>) and noticed that it didn&#8217;t work, immediately after &#8220;<span class="caps">AUTH</span> <span class="caps">TLS</span>&#8221; command the connection was disconnected. That happened independently of the server I tried to connect to and the server wasn&#8217;t aware of any disconnect. I am posting the solution here since more people might be affected by this.</p>

	<p>Turned out my router wasn&#8217;t responsible. When I looked at the issue with a network sniffer, I saw a <span class="caps">TCP</span> <span class="caps">RST</span> packet immediately after first <span class="caps">SSL</span> handshake packet&nbsp;&mdash; and that one was received with less than 0.1 ms delay which is too little even for the router. And since apparently some program on my computer was responsible, CheckPoint <span class="caps">VPN</span>-1 was my first guess, I already made the experience that this <span class="caps">VPN</span> client is overly protective and messes around with <strong>all</strong> connections made by the computer even when it isn&#8217;t active.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s what I found: <a href="https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal;solutionid=sk27122"><span class="caps">FTP</span> verifications performed by <span class="caps">VPN</span>-1</a>. So the problem is that <span class="caps">FTPS</span> starts as a regular <span class="caps">FTP</span> connection and only starts using <span class="caps">SSL</span> afterward. And since at that point the client is sending binary data, &#8220;each <span class="caps">FTP</span> command terminates with a new-line character&#8221; verification fails of course.</p>

	<p>The instructions in the support article were useless for me because I didn&#8217;t have the source files on my computer. However, the resulting file SecuRemote\state\userc.fc is still a text file and can be changed to ignore <span class="caps">FTP</span> connections. You look for the line &#8220;% function: NN ftp_code 0&#8221; (where NN is some number) and insert the following line after that:</p>

<pre><code>94000000	return
</code></pre>

	<p>That&#8217;s it. Restart CheckPoint services and <span class="caps">VPN</span>-1 should no longer bother your <span class="caps">FTP</span> connections.</p>
