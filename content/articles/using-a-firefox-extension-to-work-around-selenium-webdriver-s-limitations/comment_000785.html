		<p>It seems that tabbed browsing wasn’t invented yet back when that <span class="caps">API</span> was designed, so it only has a concept of windows — not very useful. So WebDriver will only let you work with the currently selected tab, inactive tabs are off limits.</p>

	<p>WebDriver&#8217;s definition of a window isn&#8217;t analogous to the graphical browser window; think of it more as a <span class="caps">DOM</span> window.  This means that it doesn&#8217;t distinguish between the browser&#8217;s tabs or (UI) windows.</p>

	<p>To switch to a tab you call the <code>switch_to_window</code> function with that tab&#8217;s <span class="caps">DOM</span> window&#8217;s name (<code>window.name</code>) or the internal window handle which WebDriver has assigned to it.  You can list all windows using the <code>get_window_handles</code> command.</p>

	<p>The specification also has some prose around this: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html#controlling-windows</p>

	<p>With regards to middle clicking you&#8217;ll be happy to hear that we&#8217;re in the process of specifying a new low-level actions <span class="caps">API</span> that will not only make it possible to click any mouse button, but which will also support any type of device or input mechanism (touch, stylus, controller, &amp;c.).</p>
