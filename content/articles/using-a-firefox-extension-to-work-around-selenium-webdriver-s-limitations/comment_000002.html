	<p>I remember having to deal with Selenium at a previous job. It was pretty terrible. I think my favourite issue at the time was how they pretended to support xpath, but then didn&#8217;t use the browser&#8217;s implementation and only allowed some return values, so if you wanted to look at text inside elements or know the number of matches for a particular query&#8230; tough! They were sad times &#8211; hopefully at least those bits are better now?</p>
