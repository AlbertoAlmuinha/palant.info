<p>The logic is in the browser however, <span class="caps">AMO</span> is merely providing data. For me that&#8217;s a very important difference &#8211; the browser logic is on my computer, I can go look at it and there is a changelog for each release. It won&#8217;t suddenly change because Mozilla is running a campaign. And if it changes then the change will leave traces. <span class="caps">AMO</span> has a strict policy that websites are not to be trusted &#8211; that policy applies to extensions but it also applies to the browser itself.</p>

	<p>I cannot imagine Mozilla leaving a backdoor in the browser to silently install extensions, sorry. Particularly extensions that aren&#8217;t even defined yet and could potentially do anything.</p>
