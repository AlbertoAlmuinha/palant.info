<p>Another small nit:</p>

	<p>&#8220;And another nice side-effect: Gmail automatically gets the notification permission and can display desktop notifications without asking the user for permission. Bad luck for all the other webmail services out there.&#8221; </p>

	<p>If I am understanding correctly, you can disable the option within Gmail to disable desktop notifications.  This should result with no notifications when using Chrome or any other browsers.  I have that option set and don&#8217;t see any notifications in browsers (Firefox &amp; Chrome) or on my desktop.  I log into email and view the inbox to see if I have new mail (by design).</p>

	<p>Hope that helps&#8230;</p>
