<cite>I would say it is obvious that Chrome is designed with the idea that people are stupid.</cite><br />
Not only that, but it seems to work: look how fast Chrome got a significant market share and how much Firefox apparently feels the need to ape it. (:-Ãž)<br />
<span class="caps">OTOH</span>, SeaMonkey was developed with intelligent people in mind, or at least people who were not, for instance, so stupid that an abundance of preferences would terrify them. Maybe also for people a little on the conservative side (including Netscape old-timers). In terms of market share, it seems to have been the wrong decision. But is market share the be-all and end-all of open-source browsers? I&#8217;m certain that SeaMonkey&#8217;s all-volunteer developers had some powerful motivation where market share was far from being the most important factor.<br />
Of course, market share (including most especially a share in the part of the market which is most easily &#8220;convinced&#8221; by advertising) is important <ins>to Google</ins> (which brings me back on-topic).</p>
