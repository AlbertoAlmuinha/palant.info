	<p>&#8220;One particular feature caught my attention: it marks the extensions that you already have with a check mark.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Small nit: Apparently this feature was already present in earlier iterations of the web store as the install buttons were greyed put, inactive and had a different text for extensions which you already had installed.</p>
