<p>Do you have any tool for importing comments from Wordpress into your solution? That would be supercool because I'm in the process of migrating to Hugo, and before I found your blog I planned on using Isso for comments. But that would bring a lot more server-side code than your solution. Isso has the big advantage of being able to import WP comments itself though.</p>
