<p>No, with online password managers you don't always have to trust the company. If a sane client-side encryption approach is used, the company really won't be able to access your passwords. As to work ethics, have a look at <a href="https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/former-yahoo-employee-admits-he-hacked-6000-users-accounts-stole-nude-photos-and-videos-21577.html" rel="nofollow">https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/former-yahoo-employee-admits-he-hacked-6000-users-accounts-stole-nude-photos-and-videos-21577.html</a> - do you want to bet on nobody at Google doing anything like this?</p>
<p>You are correct, having malware on your device is the worst-case scenario that password managers cannot protect you against.</p>
<p>As to Google servers being better protected - you are probably correct, even though people found really embarrassing security issues in Google servers as well. But the point is that you really shouldn't have to worry about this. Ideal scenario would be: even if somebody hacks the servers, this doesn't get them any closer to accessing the data. So you don't have to worry about hackers, rogue employees or companies with flexible ethics. Google is very far from that ideal scenario, 1Password is much closer though not without issues either, and LastPass is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>If you are syncing your passwords to Google servers, then why would anybody have to single you out? Google servers are a high-value target, if these are compromised at some point then all people keeping their data there will be affected. Of course, if you only keep passwords locally then the chances of an attack are indeed far smaller.</p>
