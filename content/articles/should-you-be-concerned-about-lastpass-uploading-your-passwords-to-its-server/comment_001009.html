<p>Looks like you did quite some research here. Im the main developer behind psono and it would be amazing if you could search a little bit around if you find something. Im always looking for ways to improve it, so even if you only have some additional security enforcements, then that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><a href="https://psono.com" rel="nofollow">Psono</a> has similar to Lastpass a client side encryption (in addition its Open Source and you can host it yourself), yet it does not load any additional ressources as Lastpass (so at least this hole is covered).</p>
