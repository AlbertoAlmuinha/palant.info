<p>Thank you sir for such a detailed answer. I have a quick follow up question, what are your thoughts on Bitwarden ? Can it be used and trusted ? I have heard good things about 1password, but its slightly expensive. I being a student, and not having lot of bucks, so would go for 1password only if there are no good free alternatives. I have tried Lastpass on and off and have mixed feelings about its clunky and sluggish UI, so in this match-up where would you put Bitwarden ???Â 
I think, just by being Open source you don't become better or more secure compared to competitors who are closed source IMHO. It just mean more people have eyes on your code (and that can also become a negative thing). Open source is better only when capable people are actually looking and actively participating in bug reporting and threat analysis. BW has had "1" third party audit, But, is it good enough in your opinion ?? 
Thank you</p>
