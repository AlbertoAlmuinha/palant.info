<p>Not only is the security questionable, but LastPass JavaScript code is very bulky and slow and can potentially boggle down your web browser on text field heavy web pages. This is due to LastPass checking every single field on the page against their internal database to see if it can auto-fill the form. There are options in LastPass to disable this, but in my experience, even after disabling it, LastPass STILL runs all the JavaScript that checks every single field on a web page against their internal database for form auto-filling, even if it doesn't actually fill the form.</p>
