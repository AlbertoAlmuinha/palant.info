<p>Yes, I&#8217;m usually recommending 1Password. While I haven&#8217;t done a thorough review there, there were no issues sticking out &#8211; which is already a lot better than everybody else. Also, their whitepaper is really good, somebody put some considerable thought into security here. Downside: there is no free plan, you have to pay for it.</p>
