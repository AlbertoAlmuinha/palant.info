<p>KeePass is another obvious alternative, but here you have to choose between security (no browser integration) and convenience (browser integration via hardly trustworthy third-party extensions).</p>

<p>There is of course <a href="https://pfp.works/" rel="nofollow">PfP: Pain-free Passwords</a> which is open source, but being its developer I am obviously biased as far as its security goes. Also, the user interface needs polishing. And there is 1Password which has a good security story but it isn&#8217;t open source and has to be paid for.</p>
