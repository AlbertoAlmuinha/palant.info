<p>To be honest, I have no idea. My understanding is that the keychain is well-protected so that malicious applications cannot steal the data easily -- that's a good thing. Also, from the info on the web it seems that Safari and Chrome support keychain natively, so you don't need to copy passwords around -- also good, probably also means that a password won't be filled in on a wrong website (phishing protection). But syncing passwords to Apple servers is something I would definitely be wary of, particularly since I know that <a href="https://palant.de/2018/03/13/can-chrome-sync-or-firefox-sync-be-trusted-with-sensitive-data/" rel="nofollow">Google and Mozilla didn't go out of their way to protect your data</a> (the former doing considerably worse).</p>
