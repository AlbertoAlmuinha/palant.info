<p>In response to Tony mac's question above: do a search for the "KeySteal" vulnerability discovered by Linus Henze, that allows an attacker to read your keychain if they can execute code under your account. As far as I know, it has not been closed at the time of writing (April 5, 2019). An example article describing it is here: https://www.cnet.com/news/keysteal-exploit-attacks-macos-keychain-to-take-all-your-passwords/</p>
