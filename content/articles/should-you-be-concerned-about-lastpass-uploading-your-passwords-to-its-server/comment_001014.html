<p>A very insightful blog like always... Thanks you @Wladimir Palant. I've been reading you blog since quite some time and I really appreciate and enjoy your blog. 
Sir, I have lot of questions regarding password management. I've read all your article regarding LastPass and password managers. 
I am currently using Google Chrome to store most of my password. I use random and different passwords for all sites and use keepass to store sensitive logins like banking and Email logins for rest Chrome password manager. All passwords I use are generated by password generators having 20+ characters. 
Just like an average user I use Chrome as default browser, google as search engine, use an Android phone, google Photos to backup my photos, Drive for docs, so i have no right to wear a tin hat on my head lols (Although I have started to change my habits and try using duckduckgo and tor network as often as I can)
So privacy wise at this point Google knows alot about me, so is it bad if they know login credentials ? They already have my history, bookmarks and cookies already. And i've read your blog about Google "passphrase" and use of SHA1, so that's more like a joke in the name of encryption, hence I don't use passphrase. Therefore it basically just boils down to if Google wants to use my data and i'll have to trust in their work ethics. But, isn't this trust factor issue with every company that provides an online password manager ?</p>
<p>Secondly about security, regarding my devices I have no threat from anyone around me at home or at work that any one will sneak up on my laptop or mobile and steel my credentials, there is "0" risk of that, in my case. And when it comes to the installation of a malware on my device then the war is already lost isn't it ? If I already have a malware or a keylogger no password manager will save me IMHO. </p>
<p>Next comes server side protection, now being a layman and having no knowledge of server security I can't comment anything. Just a gut feeling that Servers of Google (a company having infinite resource) might be better fortified then companies (comparatively very small than Google) like Lastpass or 1password or bitwarden. But again I am a layman so I might be horribly wrong. </p>
<p>And lastly I fear that in case of a online password manager if there is a data leak and my login credentials are exposed (even if passwords are encrypted) it might expose me alot more for attacks like spear phishing. Where as in case of using Google Chrome password manager the attacker will have to go after specifically me in particular, and i am not in any sense a high value target so no one will do that..</p>
<p>Sorry for such a long elaborate rant, can you clear my doubts ?? Also my apologize if my question seems dumb....
Thank you</p>
