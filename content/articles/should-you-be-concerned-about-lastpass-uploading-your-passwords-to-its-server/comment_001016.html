<p>This was an insightful article. Thank you. I was just in the process of setting up LastPass on my devices upon reading this. I need to use both Mac, Windows and iOS, and decided a cross platform password manager was a better alternative than storing passwords in the browser/keychain on the different devices. I have been reading a bit, and understand that due to for example phishing security vulnerability, I probably shouldnÂ´t use browser autofill at all. Even with e.g. 1password, it poses a risk using autofill in browser plugins?</p>
<p>If this is the case, a cross platform synced desktop app is the way to go, copying the password into the browser each time. To my understanding I think your main concerns with LastPass lies with using the browser plugins?</p>
<p>I would really like to save the monthly 5$ family plan fee for 1Password, but would be willing to pay it if browser plugin autofill is safe to use.</p>
<p>To short it up, my two main questions are as follows:
Is browser plugin autofill secure to use with 1Password?
If no(ish) to the former, is Lastpass and 1Password equaly secure if used only as desktop apps, copying passwords from the app in to the web-browser manually?</p>
