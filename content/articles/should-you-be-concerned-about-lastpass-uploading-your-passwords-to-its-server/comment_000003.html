<p>Bitwarden doesn&#8217;t do “Custom <span class="caps">URL</span> query parsing, domain checks via substring search on the host name without validating position” so I am unsure where you are seeing this. Bitwarden evaluates <span class="caps">URL</span>s via parsed hostname properties with built-in browser functions such as `new <abbr title=" "><span class="caps">URL</span></abbr>`.<br />
​<br />
Bitwarden also pays for independent security audits of the codebase. More here: https://help.bitwarden.com/article/is-bitwarden-audited/<br />
