<p>Yes, PassBolt are the good ones. It has been a while since I communicated with them, but the <a href="https://www.passbolt.com/incidents/20171228_content_scripts_malicious_domain" rel="nofollow">security issue I reported</a> got a top notch incident response. In general, they clearly understand the potential threats here and are planning their system accordingly.</p>
<p>You are wrong about the browsers, it's really not that bad. You probably <a href="https://palant.de/2018/03/13/can-chrome-sync-or-firefox-sync-be-trusted-with-sensitive-data/" rel="nofollow">don't want to have the Sync functionality enabled</a> but they won't steal your data.</p>
<p>As to using phones for 2 factor authentication, I've <a href="https://palant.de/2019/03/12/how-much-privacy-do-you-have-left-on-the-web/" rel="nofollow">written on that already</a>. I plan to have a more technical article on hardware tokens eventually.</p>
