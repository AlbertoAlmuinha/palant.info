<p>What I recommend to all you "do-it-your-selfers" out there, is to setup PassBolt, an open source self-hosted password manager. It provides PGP Security and a browser extension to make life easier. So if steal toe comes and kicks your door in, demanding access to all your passwords, well you can "accidentally" loose the key to your account and boom nothing they can do!</p>
<p>One last thought, considering that browsers these days are basically malware in a box that either through 3rd party agencies or the browser manufactures themselves collect and harvest your data one way or another without you knowing (unless you were one of those guys who actually read the entire legal doc that you clicked yes to). Does it really matter to securely store your keys anways? Your only really protecting from Sam and Sally from next door. If a government, Corporation, or any other person like myself really wants your passwords we/they will find a way to get them. Period!</p>
<p>One other final thought... consider 2 factor authentication, encouraged by many companies to further secure your service but in fact the real reason is another way to validate that you are who you say you are. It might not be a 100% fool proof yet but your phone records can be pulled through phone api's. Your name will be on the number if you are a paying customer without any modern (transparent) way of removing your name from these lists and if there is its, very cryptic on how you unsubscribe from this. I've been dealing with ATT at the moment and Twillio and hoping to get some real answers on privacy that apparently is not being honored by ATT.  Might be a good topic to write about if you are into writing on privacy and security!</p>
