<p>Disclosure: I am the Chief Defender Against the Dark Arts at 1Password.</p>
<p>One of our users asked us whether 1Password suffers from the same problems. I've written <a href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/comment/500249/#Comment_500249" rel="nofollow">an answer</a> in which I explain that we don't. We've worked hard to build 1Password so that we can acquire as little information about our uses as possible.</p>
<p>The one place where some of the criticisms you list here (partially) apply to us is with our use of our web client within some of our native clients. I discuss the problem in the forum post I linked to, and it is also discussed in our security white paper. (The issue does not apply to our browser extension, so <em>technically</em> I could have said that we aren't exposed to what you describe, but that would have been misleading.)</p>
