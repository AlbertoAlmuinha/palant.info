<p>Given that my <a href="https://pfp.works/" rel="nofollow">PfP: Pain-free Passwords</a> does pretty much the same thing - yes, that's a shameless plug. ;-)</p>
<p>I've seen your app, and it has one big issue: it runs on the web. So anybody using it has to trust you, starting with your ability to keep that server secure. For example, what if your computer gets infected with malware? And they need to trust you personally, that you never turn on them and serve up a slightly different version of that code -- something that they cannot realistically verify. Even if you have this integrity, what if the local authorities knock on your door tomorrow? And the same trust has to go towards Amazon who is your hosting provider.</p>
<p>PfP also can be used on the web but there are warnings saying that it's only for trying out the functionality. If people need the web version, they can download it and run locally.</p>
