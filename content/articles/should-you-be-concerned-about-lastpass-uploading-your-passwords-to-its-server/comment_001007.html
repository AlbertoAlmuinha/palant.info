<p>As a shameless plug, I'd like to mention a password manager application that I've built due to having trust issues with current major players in the field. Here's the website: https://derivepass.com/ . The idea is that instead of generating the passwords randomly, they're derived from a master password and domain/login pair. In this way, only encrypted domains and logins have to be synchronized between devices, instead of entrusting some entity with storing the full password.</p>
