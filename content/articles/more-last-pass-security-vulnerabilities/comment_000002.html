	<p>Yeah. I still have some browser-saved passwords I have to flush out (bad habit because KeePass currently locks after 5 minutes, my passphrase is long, and I keep forgetting to extend the timeout to make that less of an issue) but I don&#8217;t really mind having to hit Win+P much in and of itself.</p>
