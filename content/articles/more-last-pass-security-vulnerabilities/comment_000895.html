	<p>&#8220;Last Pass resolved this issue by restricting this communication channel to lastpass.com and lastpass.eu domains. So now these are the only websites that can read out your browsing history.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Worth noting, of course, that if either domain ever has <span class="caps">XSS</span> vulnerabilities, functionally that capability would extend to every website, not just those two.  <span class="caps">MDN</span>&#8217;s window.postMessage documentation at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage notes that &#8220;a security hole in the site you trusted to send only trusted messages could then open a cross-site scripting hole in your site&#8221;.  Or in this case, your addon and all data it can expose via that channel.  Perhaps I should update that section of the document to note that one should be very careful what actions one permits via postMessage, for this reason &#8212; and to explicitly distinguish it from the improper-syntax concern already called out in bolded terms.</p>
