	<p>&#8220;So when the Firefox password manager requires user interaction these days (entering the first letter of the password) before filling in your password — that’s why.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Huh. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been having to rely on my KeePass Win+P auto-type shortcut more and more these days.</p>

	<p>(I give each site a unique 20-character random password generated and managed by KeePass. I don&#8217;t <span class="caps">KNOW</span> the first character of a given site&#8217;s password.)</p>

	<p>I really do need to come up with a more secure solution than matching on the window title, though. KeePass doesn&#8217;t keep track of <span class="caps">URL</span>s to match against and Firefox&#8217;s password manager UX is unacceptable for situations where auto-fill or &#8220;automatically offer to save password&#8221; fail for some reason.</p>
