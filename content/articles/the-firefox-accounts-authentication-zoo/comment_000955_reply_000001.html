<p>Why would you want your own FxA server? I guess this is about sync? Reproducing the entire infrastructure would be a massive effort, doesn&#8217;t seem worth it. Using the official FxA service with your own sync server should be fine. While Mozilla might be able to guess your master password (see my other blog post), they won&#8217;t have access to the data on your server so this setup should be safe.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that Mozilla is planning to simplify this architecture. It currently works for them, and allowing third-party installs doesn&#8217;t seem to be a priority.</p>
