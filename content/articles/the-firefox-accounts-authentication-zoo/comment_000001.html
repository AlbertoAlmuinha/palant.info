<p>Thanks a lot for this nice overview, I now do understand why I didn&#8217;t understand the whole thing. I&#8217;m glad you gave a reported your insights. Just one final question: is it worth to install you own <span class="caps">FXA</span>-server, or should we wait for mozilla to re-implement their stuff with a modern perspective?</p>
