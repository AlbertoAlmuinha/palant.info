Putting an upper limit to the links will surely help. Resolving relative <span class="caps">URI</span>s without depending on the <span class="caps">DOM</span> would be nice too, even though I never considered this feature performance-sensitive, since it should be triggered on an almost negligible number of pages and anyway whatever you do performance-wise (upper limits aside) can&#8217;t <em>eliminate</em> <span class="caps">DOS</span> issues.</p>

	<p>Regarding the debugger interfaces, doesn&#8217;t (Fire|Chrome)Bug depend on them?</p>
