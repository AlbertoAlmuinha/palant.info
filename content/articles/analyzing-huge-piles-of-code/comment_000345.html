	<p><strong>@Wladimir</strong>:<br />
<span class="caps">BTW</span>, have you got any idea of why Venkman is so random in detecting JS components? I&#8217;ve got profiles where I can somehow debug them, and profile where they are totally invisible :-k</p>

	<p><strong>@Haploid</strong>:<br />
That&#8217;s the JS redirect detection feature (introduced by request of Josh Soref <span class="caps">AKA</span> timeless), which scans script elements on script-disabled <em>and</em> link-less pages to find if they would try to automatically navigate user if JavaScript was enabled. This come quite handy on many silly empty pages which just redirect you to the &#8220;real&#8221; content using JavaScript.</p>

	<p>Of course, like JavaScript itself and many other browser-built-in features, some NoScript&#8217;s features (and probably some AdBlock Plus&#8217; as well) can be abused for &#8220;<span class="caps">DOS</span>&#8221; purposes, but fortunately since we&#8217;re still JavaScript you can halt the loop after a while.</p>
