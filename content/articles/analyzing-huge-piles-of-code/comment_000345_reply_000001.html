<p>I doubt you want to make that regexp more strict about what it considers to be a link. But it would probably help to limit the number of detected &#8220;links&#8221; ;)<br />
Or at least use hash tables to detect duplicates. And use nsIIOService.newURI() to resolve relative links rather than insert a link element into the document only to remove it immediately (not exactly a cheap operation).</p>
