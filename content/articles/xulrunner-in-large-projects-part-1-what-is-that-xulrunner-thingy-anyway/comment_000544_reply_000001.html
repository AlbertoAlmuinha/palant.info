<p>What kind of error reporting do you expect? The Error Console that you have in Firefox is part of any <span class="caps">XULR</span>unner application &#8211; just specify &#8220;-jsconsole&#8221; on the command line. At that point you should see all errors and any debug output you might write to console. You won&#8217;t get the full stack this way but that&#8217;s something you can relatively easily add to your application (we&#8217;ve done it in TomTom <span class="caps">HOME</span>).</p>
