<p>It has been a while since I tried that extension with Firefox Mobile, but as far as I am aware the main issue is the icon pop-up, there is no support for this kind of UI (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370333" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1370333</a>). One could open the &#8220;pop-up&#8221; in a tab as a work-around but filling in passwords would be quite awkward then. But eventually this extension will certainly run on Firefox Mobile.</p>

	<p>I also have thoughts about a standalone Android app, which would be more advanced than the webpage you are using right now. In particular, it should autocomplete website names and display the available passwords. That might take a while however, also because sync functionality is a prerequisite here.</p>
