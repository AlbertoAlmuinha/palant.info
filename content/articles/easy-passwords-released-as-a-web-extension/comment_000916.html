<p>This sounds great! I almost began questioning whether it was a good choice to start using Easy Passwords only for it to become incompatible after half a year of usage.<br />
Do you see a chance for making the extension compatible with Firefox for Android? That is my main pain point right now &#8212; I am currently using the static web page right now (with some custom <span class="caps">CSS</span>, to make it more touch-friendly and Material-y). But it is a bit annoying to always enter the master password and the fact that the resulting password is displayed in plain text also makes it a bit insecure with shoulder surfers. Hm&#8230; I suspect I could just add Clipboard.js to solve the latter issue. The former issue could also be worked around, by storing the password in Firefox&#8217;s password manager but that completely defeats the purpose.</p>
