<p>Generated passwords (the default) are not being stored at all. We currently use PBKDF2 algorithm to derive them from the master password, switching to scrypt algorithm here is in progress (see <a href="https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues/58" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues/58</a>). You can read more about the concept behind this in my other blog post, <a href="https://palant.de/2016/04/20/security-considerations-for-password-generators" rel="nofollow">https://palant.de/2016/04/20/security-considerations-for-password-generators</a>.</p>

	<p>Legacy passwords and password notes are being stored, currently encrypted with <span class="caps">AES</span>-256-<span class="caps">CBC</span>. Encrypting the entire data storage (including user names which aren&#8217;t relevant for security) is work in progress, we will switch to <span class="caps">AES</span>-256-<span class="caps">GCM</span> while at it (see <a href="https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues/47" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues/47</a>).</p>
