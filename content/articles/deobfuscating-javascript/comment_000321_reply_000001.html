<p>Yes, I have seen it. But it won&#8217;t tell you what a live web site is running. You have to locate the code that you want to analyze (which can easily get extremely complicated), and then this code might have enough dependencies on the <span class="caps">DOM</span> that you will never see anything useful outside a browser. Not to mention that intercepting eval() and document.write() isn&#8217;t sufficient &#8211; something that I explained in just that blog post.</p>
