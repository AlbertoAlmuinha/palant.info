	<p><a href="http://www.csoonline.com/read/010107/fea_vuln.html">The Chilling Effect</a> is quite interesting read (yes, the article is a few months old but I only discovered it now). It shows nicely how security research on web applications is different from research on software you install on your computer. It also shows why responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities is so rare in this field. I also find it very interesting how it explains that most software is of a low quality.</p>
