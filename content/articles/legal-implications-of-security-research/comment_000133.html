<p>I just wanted to say, that your adblock plugin is not just a <span class="caps">MUST</span> &#8211; it&#8217;s beyond that. I have never enjoyed surfing websites as much as I do now, with all the adsense and banners gone, things are so pretty. </p>

	<p>Your plugin isn&#8217;t something which should be avoided, it&#8217;s something which should be a standard on all web browsers. And for a sidekick &#8211; the commercialists gets ruined if enough people begin using this plugin.</p>

	<p>And I am doing my best to spread the word through my website, this is just too excellent to miss out on =)</p>

	<p>Good work, keep it going and have fun!</p>
