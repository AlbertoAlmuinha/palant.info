	<p>I also don&#8217;t see the rationale for this. </p>

	<p>1. Chrome add-ons really can&#8217;t do that much compared to Firefox add-ons.<br />
2. I don&#8217;t see how there can possibly be more Chrome add-ons (especially of any value), so why bother tapping into that market?<br />
3. Mozilla need to focus on not losing the one key benefit of Firefox, which is its current add-on ecosystem, and being able to port worse extensions doesn&#8217;t help.<br />
4. If people were really that bothered about writing cross-browser add-ons, they&#8217;ve probably done it already. It&#8217;s a bit late to try and standardise things now (especially if everyone&#8217;s going to have their own proprietary hooks anyway).</p>
