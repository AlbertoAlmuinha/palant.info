	<p>I would love to know how many Mozilla folks involved in making this decision have actually developed really useful Chrome extensions (as opposed to just looking at the <span class="caps">API</span>).</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m surprised people like you (that have developed for both Firefox and Chrome) weren&#8217;t consulted as to how useful the Chrome <span class="caps">API</span> really is.</p>

	<p>To me, this is really an acknowledgement that Chrome has somehow won the extension war. I find that an odd conclusion.</p>
