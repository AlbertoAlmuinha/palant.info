	<p>Once upon a time everybody was &#8220;making the Web&#8221; meaning the Web was Internet Explorer. Less tech users actually believed the &#8220;e&#8221; icon on the desktop was &#8220;the Internet&#8221;.</p>

	<p>Few people considered &#8220;other browsers&#8221;, at the time Opera and whatever Netscape was doing. From the ashes of Netscape rose Phoenix, then named Firebird, then Firefox (If I recall it correctly). </p>

	<p>Was Firefox &#8220;compatible&#8221; with Internet Explorer? Was it trying to appeal developers by sort of &#8220;common api&#8221;?  Did even Firefox mimic Internet Explorer design? On the contrary, it went in the opposite direction in almost any aspect.</p>

	<p>But above everything else, did people making Firefox believe their software was actually hopeless and inferior and they did not have the man power to do anything different/better than IE so all they could do was sort of &#8220;side projects&#8221; that are born to be irrelevant (like, sorry, FirefoxOS)?</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know what Mozilla stands for, is it a no-profit organization driven by ethics (and/or politics) that use software as excuse to exist or does Mozilla develop innovative software as mission?</p>

	<p>The thing here is you can even take away any kind of extension/addon from the browser and provide only hardcoded features but you must give something in return. Your browser must be <span class="caps">BETTER</span> than the others in a way o another. By saying you are adopting the same &#8220;model&#8221; as Chrome and/or you are becoming &#8220;compatible&#8221;, without giving any actual improvement over Chrome as a whole, you are saying you use Chrome at home.</p>
