	<p>[ TL;DR : From reading your blog post I get the impression you, just as almost everyone else who read the announcement, myself included on my first read-through, took WebExtensions as the future one and absolute way of writing an extension. <span class="caps">IMO</span>, WE isn&#8217;t supposed to be the <strong>only</strong> way to code an add-on, but rather <strong>a</strong> framework to do it, replacing the <span class="caps">SDK</span>. ]</p>

	<p>I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is the distinction between all the subjects covered in the announcement:</p>

	<p>- as you said yourself, alternatives to <span class="caps">XUL</span> and <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> have become an increasing necessity, deprecating <span class="caps">XUL</span>-based add-ons and those that use <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> is the logical first step in getting there;<br />
- signing has also become a necessity for its own reasons;<br />
- so has e10s, I think we all want a faster and more stable browser;<br />
- WE was introduced as the future alternative to the <span class="caps">SDK</span>, it is meant to (supposedly?) achieve the same goals, both in end-product functionality and in ease-of-development, with a few added bonuses, the biggest of which seems to be browser portability.</p>

	<p>All of those points are valid, and they have nothing to do with each other. They just happened to be jumbled up in the same blog announcement because they&#8217;re happening at the same time (and logically there will be some overlap in achieving all these goals), so most of it was lost in the middle of the whole &#8220;holy hell&#8221; reaction. You&#8217;re right that the <span class="caps">SDK</span> has matured over the years, but if you look at it from the outside, it seems to me the <span class="caps">SDK</span> was a sort of pre-WE in itself: it has its own modules to interact with the browser in its own &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; ways.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">IMHO</span>, if I look only to the WE over <span class="caps">SDK</span> part and forget everything else, WE apparently aims to bring the best points from other established models (Blink) into Firefox, some things that the <span class="caps">SDK</span> doesn&#8217;t have or can&#8217;t do as it is.</p>

	<p>Maybe those things could have been brought into the <span class="caps">SDK</span> itself as has been suggested all around, I guess the design decision there was more in favor of browser portability than continuance. Whether that&#8217;s actually good or bad, well I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s good for those that developer for multiple browsers, and I&#8217;m also sure that it in itself shouldn&#8217;t really hurt those that develop only for Firefox.</p>

	<p>I also wasn&#8217;t a fan of the <span class="caps">SDK</span> at first (I&#8217;ve still never used it actually), precisely because when it was in its infancy it could barely do anything useful. That&#8217;s the stage WE is in right now. And remember the goal at the time the <span class="caps">SDK</span> was created was &#8220;let&#8217;s bring as many developers as we can into using it&#8221;. Now apparently the goal with WE is &#8220;we want even more developers using WE than that&#8221;, and if it the point is to try and fit into it as much as add-ons need, as far as signs go I can&#8217;t say that&#8217;s particularly a bad one.</p>

	<p>What is setting off this little wave of rage and despair is that unfortunately the announcement made it sound like WE will be the <strong>only way</strong> to create add-ons, which I believe is false. <span class="caps">XUL</span>-based and <span class="caps">SDK</span>-based add-ons aren&#8217;t the only formats, you can also create a blank bootstrap.js file and code a restartless add-on from scratch without using a single piece of the <span class="caps">SDK</span>. I did, many times over.</p>

	<p>(I&#8217;m an optimist, I haven&#8217;t seen anything about dropping support for regular restartless add-ons, so I presume those will stay, even if they need some kind of special permission in the new WE permissions model to allow them to work. I did voice that idea just to be safe: https://webextensions.uservoice.com/forums/315663-webextension-api-ideas/suggestions/9440937-deprecate-xul-does-not-mean-deprecate-all-add-ons, and I wasn&#8217;t the only one apparently.)</p>

	<p>I think that&#8217;s the key point, because while I agree there isn&#8217;t a rationale for WE to become <strong>the only way</strong> to create Firefox add-ons, that&#8217;s of course a little insane to say the least, there is definitely a rationale, and a good one <span class="caps">IMO</span>, for WE as <strong>a framework model</strong> to create Firefox add-ons. To that point, so far I&#8217;ve not seen any <span class="caps">XUL</span>-based add-on that couldn&#8217;t be converted into a restartless format, with more or less effort of course depending on the case:</p>

	<p>- <span class="caps">XUL</span> deprecation is irrelevant, whatever you modify now you can still do so in an <span class="caps">HTML</span> environment as long as you have access to the <span class="caps">DOM</span> tree, and any anonymous nodes or <span class="caps">XBL</span> binding methods that go with it can be changed as well (now and in whatever comes to replace them) with some clever JS&#8217;ing;</p>

	<p>- <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> also has alternatives apparently, although I won&#8217;t say much about them as I&#8217;ve never used them myself, I&#8217;m just basing that on the impression I get from what I gather here and there;</p>

	<p>- signing isn&#8217;t a deal breaker, pretty much everything on <span class="caps">AMO</span> is signed already, add-ons not hosted there can also be signed (it is extremely easy to do it even), everyone can sign their personal add-ons without having them listed or made public, anyone can pick up an abandoned add-on and submit it as-is for signing and republish it, developers will be able to use unsigned versions in NIghtly and Dev.Edition and even in release and beta Firefox (those complaining about this should do proper research, &#8220;unbranded versions&#8221; means &#8220;exactly the same Firefox version except for the name and logo&#8221;), <span class="caps">ESR</span> will apparently keep the preference to not enforce signing, and lots more should be coming in the future, what more could anyone want? :)</p>

	<p>- e10s, well in many cases that will take a little work I guess, but if I, an absolutely amateur coder with no academic background in any kind of computers sciences what-so-ever doing everything in his spare time, managed to rewrite FindBar Tweak, an add-on that was absolutely riddled with e10s-related problems because it touched web content in every step of the way, to an e10s-friendly format, then the same absolutely can be done for every other add-on out there, it only takes some effort, and you won&#8217;t believe the performance increase I tell&#8217;z ya&#8217; :)</p>

	<p>To quote myself, I&#8217;ve always believed it is the job of an add-on developer to adapt with Firefox, and not the other way around; after all, add-ons are made for Firefox, Firefox isn&#8217;t made <strong>for</strong> add-ons. (I know this is a point that many don&#8217;t agree with, but as far as middle ground goes, I think it&#8217;s the most appropriate way of looking at things.) Obviously some add-ons will be left behind <strong>if</strong> no one works on them, but if Firefox is rapidly and deeply changing, so must its add-ons.</p>

	<p>With that in mind, we&#8217;re at a stage where every add-on needs to adapt, as Firefox itself is undergoing massive changes. WE comes as a (future) alternative, for those who decide to (re)write their add-ons from scratch, just as the <span class="caps">SDK</span> is/does now. But as long as it doesn&#8217;t become the <strong>only</strong> way to code add-ons as I hope it doesn&#8217;t, the world of Firefox add-ons will be fine, it just needs some evolving and work done in order to keep going.</p>
