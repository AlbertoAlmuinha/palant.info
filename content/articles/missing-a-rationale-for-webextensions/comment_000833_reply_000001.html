<p>Interesting, I must have missed a whole lot of discussions. Many <span class="caps">SDK</span> add-ons using low-level <span class="caps">API</span>s doesn&#8217;t really match my experience &#8211; at least the simple add-ons I&#8217;ve seen didn&#8217;t do that. For the more complicated add-ons the high-level <span class="caps">API</span>s provided were insufficient, sure. But these add-ons wouldn&#8217;t have worked with Chrome <span class="caps">API</span>s either. If one wants to extend Chrome <span class="caps">API</span>s, extending high-level <span class="caps">API</span>s in the <span class="caps">SDK</span> would work just the same (and have the advantage of using CommonJS instead of ugly namespacing).</p>

	<p>Sure, obfuscating the required modules is always possible. However, <span class="caps">AMO</span> already requires the unobfuscated form for any source code. And it&#8217;s not like the permissions model would make reviews obsolete, I sincerely hope that this is not the idea here.</p>
