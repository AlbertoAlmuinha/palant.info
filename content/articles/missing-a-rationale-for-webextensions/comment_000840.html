<p>Hi Wladimir,</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve seen a number of add-on developers who have publicly declared that they&#8217;ve had enough of Mozilla&#8217;s shenanigans &#8211; and that they&#8217;d halt developing their add-ons. Greasemonkey&#8217;s developer also seemed quite annoyed at the prospect of rewriting pretty much everything, after having spent 9 months making it compatible with e10s. DownThemAll is pretty much counting down the seconds to the add-on&#8217;s demise.</p>

	<p>I guess many users are wondering whether you and the team would still be committed enough to the <span class="caps">ABP</span> project to jump through the many hoops now required, vis-a-vis WebExtensions&#8230; Although it&#8217;s still early days, this does not bode well for Mozilla&#8217;s reputation. I, for one, am deeply disappointed with Mozilla&#8217;s lack of clear direction, despite having hung on over the last couple of years.</p>

	<p>Shame about the large baggage of experience and code they&#8217;re about to chuck.</p>
