	<p>My best guess for why the Mozilla leadership and some engineering talent are pushing &#8220;Webextensions&#8221; is a desire to tap the existing Chrome extension market, because that is what Microsoft is doing with Edge. It appears from the outside that there is a real fear that Gecko products will lose future, innovative Add-Ons because Gecko lacks a &#8220;somewhat-like-Chrome&#8221; extension system. What really frustrates me is their appeal to standardization. There is no evidence that Google, Opera, or Microsoft intend to freeze their <span class="caps">API</span>s and submit them to W3C or <span class="caps">WHATWG</span>, and it seems naive to assume that they will because Mozilla asked nicely and wrote good code. A plain admission: &#8220;we want to attract Chrome developers to Gecko,&#8221; seems much less naive and far more forward thinking. Yes, it&#8217;s an admission of defeat, but it&#8217;s far less confusing.</p>

	<p>I want to think that Mozilla can invent something for Gecko that is <span class="caps">BETTER</span> than Chrome&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span>s, reusing some of the work that went into Jetpack, Firefox OS and Apps. Call it something catchy &#8212; &#8220;Rocket Boots Ignite LightBeam Spark Mandrill&#8221; or something and then release some community-owned Blink compatibility JS shims on github. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s much, much harder. A man can dream, though.</p>

	<p>Ah well.</p>
