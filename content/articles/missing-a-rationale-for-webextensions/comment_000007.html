	<p>As a developer who loves Mozilla, I want to remind them that Mozilla does not have enough resource to compete with Google. Even if WebExtensions become somehow an standarized think (which I really doubt that), still the only one who benefits from this is Google Chrome. People solely use Firefox because they can alter it the way they like to, not because it is fast, nor because it is as responsive as Chrome. </p>

	<p>I do understand that security is the concern here, but why instead of blocking something useful like require(&#8216;chrome&#8217;), why not just warning users the extension can access to your sensitive data?</p>

	<p>Also note that you will need something like require(&#8216;chrome&#8217;) even in your new ecosystem. Without this small thing, Firefox is yet another clone to Google Chrome from extension development point of view.</p>

	<p>Let me emphasis one more thing here, as Wladimir also noted, it is to Firefox benefit to not have same <span class="caps">API</span>s as Chrome supports, although I do think Chrome extensions need to be compatible with Firefox which can be achieved just by writing a simple wrapper to the current <span class="caps">SDK</span>. This way Firefox could take advantage of all the Chrome&#8217;s extensions gallery as well as its own gallery.</p>

	<p>Let me remind one other important issue with abandoning current extensions as well. I am pretty sure at least 50% of current addons hosted on <span class="caps">AMO</span> are not being actively developed anymore. Most of the developers just maintain their extensions. You cannot definitely ask these developers to migrate their extensions to the new system. And guess how many users are in Firefox just because of these small not-really-maintained-anymore extensions.</p>
