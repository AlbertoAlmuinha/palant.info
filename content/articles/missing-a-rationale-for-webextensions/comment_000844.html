<p>I read this in a reply by @Wladamir:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Note that Adblock Plus exists for both Firefox and Chrome â€“ and yet we are horrified at the prospect of using the Chrome version in Firefox. &#8220;</p>

	<p>I think that speaks a thousand volumes!! Amen baby!</p>

	<p>Also I highly doubt security of Firefox addons was ever an issue, we have a great review process that has proved over and over again to be more secure then google chromes.</p>

	<p>Even with our awesome power of addons, the review process has been a fool proof way of ensuring security.</p>

	<p>And the new signing process ensures security on addons not on addons.mozilla.org (<span class="caps">AMO</span>) so I don&#8217;t believe this &#8220;WebExtensions <span class="caps">API</span> is needed as we had security issues&#8221;.  We never had security issues due to the review process. And any ones that would come up would be squashed by the signing process.</p>
