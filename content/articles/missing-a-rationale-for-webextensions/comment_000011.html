	<p>(In reply to your reply&#8230;)</p>

	<p>To make this one shorter, I absolutely agree with everything you said. In particular, I would have also preferred to see a continuance of the <span class="caps">SDK</span>, although I also don&#8217;t know why this decision was made. I find it unfortunate that you may be right (no disrespect intended of course), in that while WE has its place and can even be the preferred method, it may also lead to deprecating the whole current restartless/all-internals-accessing add-ons format, like I&#8217;ve also seen suggested before, as have you I&#8217;m sure.</p>

	<p>For instance in your example with <span class="caps">ABP</span>, you&#8217;ll have to make lots of sacrifices similar to the Chrome version, and that&#8217;s a real shame considering not only the nature of the add-on but also how popular it is. And that&#8217;s not even mentioning quite a lot of add-ons that rely on the depths of Firefox (like mine) which won&#8217;t have the <span class="caps">API</span>s they would need so easily, some of which I can&#8217;t even imagine how they would work.</p>

	<p>But then again, the announcement was made only 4 days ago, and none of this will happen over night. Lots of opinions are still being voiced all around, which was the point anyway. I guess I&#8217;m an optimist in presuming I&#8217;m right and you&#8217;re wrong (again, no disrespect intended) about making WE the only way to write add-ons. When the developer of the most popular Firefox add-on out there so eloquently suggests it might suffer with WE, at least as things stand now, I find it hard to believe that something won&#8217;t be done to help with that. :)</p>
