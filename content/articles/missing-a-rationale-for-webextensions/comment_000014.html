	<p>I strongly agree with your article.</p>

	<p>The review process by a human is critical. I know users of Gchrome and they refuse to download anything from the google extension store.</p>

	<p>I am for <span class="caps">ADDING</span> WebExtensions but not removing all that we have right now. I want to add it because: (1) it brings all of chromes addons to firefox (2) firefox addons will not go over to chrome (3) this webext api is a step simpler then addon-sdk, newbies can jump into this api more easily, and then grow into addon-sdk and then classic bootstrap</p>

	<p>I take pride in my addons not being compatible with anything else other then Firefox. I would hate to see my addons go to help other browsers who are absolutely cruel to the user. I like your example of &#8220;gchrome show a warnning on addon install, trains users to ignore them, and when they accept them its not googles fault for whatever privacy violations&#8221; thats just a simple example of how evil google is.</p>

	<p>Lets take their addons though and bring them to firefox. But that doesnt mean we have to remove our wonderful addons already existing and which years of work has gone into by addon developers.</p>

	<p>Us firefox addon devs that are firefox only really cared for it. When gchrome cam around and addon devs jumped to gchrome they spit on firefox, why should we cater to them? We should cater to the ones to stuck with firefox through the thick and thin, and did their best to help out through the thin.</p>
