	<p>I am back from my vacation and working through all the mail I got in the two weeks. Amongst others I found a funny email bounce for the forum&#8217;s confirmation message: &#8220;We are not aware of anyone in Germany needing to email us&#8221;. That is already weird enough but ok &mdash; the forum sends mails using a DE domain as a sender, maybe they don&#8217;t like that. So I forwarded the mail using my @adblockplus.org address. The new bounce message was: &#8220;We are not aware of anyone in Norway needing to email us&#8221;. This time I finally got it &mdash; Americans only want to speak to other Americans :)</p>
