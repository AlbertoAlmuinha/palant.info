	<p>To address the “reproductive defects”, shouldn’t it save the page as it currently appears <span class="caps">AFTER</span> manipulation of the <span class="caps">DOM</span> by JavaScript? That would also have the benefit of not saving things that had been removed by Adblock Plus, right? Of course that solution has its own difficulties, such as how to remove the JavaScript that manipulates the <span class="caps">DOM</span> without removing other JavaScript. And even if you could do so you’d be removing JavaScript that is needed to get things to work correctly in IE (such as the JavaScript trick to get <span class="caps">PNG</span> alpha blending to work in IE).</p>
