<p>Thanks for the junk advertising. You are wrong, Adblock Plus prevents things from being downloaded and put into the browser cache. And &#8220;Save Page As&#8221; does in fact download things it cannot find in the browser cache without consulting content policies &#8211; including images blocked by Adblock Plus. Which is a bug in the &#8220;Save Page As&#8221; feature and should be fixed.</p>
