<p>Why should TraceMonkey help with saving the JavaScript state? It is only a different JavaScript engine, not a solution for everything. It doesn&#8217;t change the fact that serializing a JavaScript state is inherently difficult.</p>

	<p>Mozilla could easily use the jar: protocol to save an entire webpage in a single file &#8211; but will yet another proprietary format really make the world better? As you already mention, there are currently three different and incompatible solutions implemented by different browsers. So I still think that supporting <span class="caps">MHTML</span> would offer the most value to the user because it would make 90% of the browser market interoperable. But when I googled I found a big &#8220;oops&#8221;: <a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6886132/description.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6886132/description.html</a>. Guess supporting <span class="caps">MHTML</span> is out of question then.</p>
