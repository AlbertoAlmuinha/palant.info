	<p>We really, really do need <span class="caps">MHTML</span> support &#8211; it&#8217;s a wonderful format, that lets you save a complete web page in a single file, and a great way to keep a complete, atomic copy of a web page. Everyone who has saved <span class="caps">MHT</span> files in IE before is now stuck with IE if they want to be able to see them in the future &#8211; we&#8217;re letting them maintain lockin by not implementing what is essentially an open format!</p>

	<p>Saving as <span class="caps">PDF</span> is also something that&#8217;s awesome and thankfully my grumbling about it make then reopen the bug for it :)</p>
