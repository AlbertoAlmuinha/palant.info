	<p>Unless I specifically need the saved <span class="caps">HTML</span> version, I don&#8217;t generally use that feature &#8211; mostly for the second reason. If I order something online and want a copy of the order acknowledgement, I print the page to file (currently Postscript, but <span class="caps">PDF</span> would be nice) so I&#8217;ve got an exact copy.</p>
