	<p>Well, I&#8217;m aware of those issues. So, is there any standard for archiving web pages? If yes, it should be followed, otherwise FF should set one. When it comes to <span class="caps">JAR</span> and its association with java, then I&#8217;d suggest using a different extension name, e.g. war (I know it&#8217;s been used by java web apps, this times it&#8217;d stand for web archive). It&#8217;s archive file format after all. This time you get a single file of standardized archiving file format, accessible by FF (other browsers would learn to use it too).</p>
