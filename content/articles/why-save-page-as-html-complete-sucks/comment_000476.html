	<p>I realize this is old; however your blog is always a treasure trove, Wladimir.<br />
<cite>restoring JavaScript properties on <span class="caps">DOM</span> objects that donâ€™t have an ID, references from JavaScript to <span class="caps">DOM</span> objects that are not in any document or are in the document of a different window, user actions during page load when the JavaScript event handlers are not yet in place.</cite> Wouldn&#8217;t TraceMonkey address this?</p>

	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML" rel="nofollow"><span class="caps">MHTML</span> at Wikipedia</a><br />
I think this is relevant to read and contemplate before moving forward in designing and architecture. <br />
Quote from article: <cite>Konqueror ..does include a feature for saving web pages as single files (&#8220;web archives&#8221;, file extension <strong>.war</strong>) that are actually gzipped tarballs..</cite><br />
<span class="caps">TGZ</span> is a suboptimal format for rapid access, if you ask me.</p>

	<p>Apple went proprietary with Safari..Thanks Apple. :D</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t use IE anymore &#8212; mostly because of AB+ &#8212; however the <span class="caps">MHT</span> concept is great. I have also used them on my phone as a reference.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">PDF</span> would work, however last time I looked it was rather static so I think keeping <span class="caps">HTML</span> is better.<br />
<span class="caps">MHTML</span> <em>should</em> also be compressed which is better than multiple files with the current FF implementation.</p>

	<p>Ideally the format would be standardized by the w3c (how long would <span class="caps">THAT</span> take??) if <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557" rel="nofollow"><span class="caps">RFC</span> 2557 <span class="caps">MHTML</span></a> is insufficient.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">FYI</span>, there <strong>is</strong> and unpacker for <span class="caps">MHTML</span> <strong>from</strong> the <strong>Microsoft</strong> Office Area however a quick search didn&#8217;t find the addon &#8212; which adds  options in the context menu to compile/decompile saved files &#8212; to those interested.</p>

	<p><sup>p.s. Wladimir you are and inspiration and a role model, good sir! Thank you for <span class="caps">ALL</span> of your amazing work!</sup></p>
