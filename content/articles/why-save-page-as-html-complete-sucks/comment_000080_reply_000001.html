<p>I thought about it. Support for JARs has been there at least since Netscape 6.0 so if they are trying to sell it to you as a new feature in FF3 – don’t believe them :). I see three problems with JARs:</p>

	<ul>
<li> You have compatibility issues again because no other browser will open them</li>
<li> I am not sure whether you can have relative <span class="caps">JAR</span> URLs (meaning showing to other files inside the same <span class="caps">JAR</span> without knowing the name of the <span class="caps">JAR</span> file)</li>
<li> The default action if you double-click a <span class="caps">JAR</span> is not starting the browser but running it as a Java application</li>
</ul>

	<p>You can solve the last two issues by saving the main <span class="caps">HTML</span> page outside the <span class="caps">JAR</span> – but then the <span class="caps">JAR</span> file doesn’t have any advantages compared to a directory for the same files.</p>
