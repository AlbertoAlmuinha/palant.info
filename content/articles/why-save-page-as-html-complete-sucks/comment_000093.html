<p>You don&#8217;t see the difference between pre and post processing: by the time Adblock Plus begins to do its job, the undesirable object is probably already in the browser&#8217;s cache. &#8220;Save As&#8221; probably just functions to pull an exact copy of what&#8217;s already in the browser&#8217;s cache out into the user&#8217;s desired directory. So you get all the web bugs, etc&#8230; and depending on the relative/absolute filter paths, the Adblock Plus filter may or may not supress correctly when opening from the local directories. In order to get pre-processing, where the bugs, etc. are not downloaded, the incoming data needs to be inspected before the browser.<br />
Agnitum&#8217;s free Outpost firewall does this- one configurable filter intercepts the incoming data and if incoming network traffic matches a pattern (such as a 1&#215;1 gif), it dies. Of course this is counterproducive on webpages that use some sort of script to make certain that everything gets downloaded b/c it will try unsuccessfully forever (click, click, click&#8230;)to get its bugs/ads downloaded. Of course Outpost can identify that script and not load it either and then the webmaster makes the page unviewable until the script is loaded&#8230; so the user installs a commercial Anti-ad$ that replaces undesirable script with harmless script for a yearly$, but Anti-ad$ downloads update$, hogs system resources/<span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles and on and on infinitum.</p>
