	<p>I had to laugh out loudly on this one. The IEBlog announces the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/03/16/announcing-ie-add-ons-contest-winners.aspx">winners of the IE Add-ons Contest</a>. Guess who won the Grand Prize? Apparently it is a great Internet Explorer add-on called &#8220;Inline Search&#8221;:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Inline Search provides a way to search for content on a webpage without bringing up the Find Dialog.  It incorporates find as you type, highlights search terms and has several other really useful features!</p>

	<p>Does that sound familiar?</p>
