	<p>Well, sure, the Grand Prize was for something that&#8217;s been built in to Firefox since 1.0, but the First Prize was for something that&#8217;s only been built in since 2.0, and Second Prize has only been a Firefox extension since around 0.10, and Third Prize is old news on any browser, and&#8230;</p>

	<p>IEWatch, though, if they really mean the description, is LiveHTTPHeaders only with <span class="caps">SSL</span> sniffing (plus various WebDev extensions), which could come in handy &#8211; last time I looked for something like that, I didn&#8217;t have much luck. Of course, I wasn&#8217;t looking for browser addons that cost $169, either.</p>
