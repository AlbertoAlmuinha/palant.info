<p>The built-in content blocker has a trivial user interface: &#8220;Block images from &#8230;&#8221; context menu item that can be checked or unchecked. The rest of the user interface is well-hidden in the Firefox preferences, most users will never see it (and neither do they <strong>need</strong> to see it). That&#8217;s how it should be.</p>

	<p>The Adblock Plus user interface on the other hand is much more complicated. Selecting &#8220;Adblock image&#8221; from the context menu will not have immediate effect, instead you are required to make a filter out of the image&#8217;s address &#8211; lots and lots of possible failure points there. Subscriptions are a very significant improvement, theoretically they make a &#8220;switch on and forget about it&#8221; user interface possible. Complicating factor being that &#8220;one subscription to rule them all&#8221; is unlikely to be a successful concept, meaning that at least parts of the current user interface have to stay somewhere where they can be found by advanced users yet don&#8217;t confuse newbies.</p>

	<p>Giving users a choice between a larger number of subscriptions (something that Adblock Plus is currently doing) is not a viable solution in the long term &#8211; most users are absolutely clueless about which subscription suits them best.</p>
