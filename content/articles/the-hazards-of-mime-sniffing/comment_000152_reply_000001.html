<p>Mozilla already provides the basic building blocks, they are called XULRunner. While Firefox doesn&#8217;t run on top of XULRunner yet, this should change by Firefox 3.0. And everybody is allowed to bring out his own modified version of Firefox (see Flock and Netscape). Yet Firefox should be always the same thing, regardless of where you download it from &#8211; users need to trust the brand, they should know that this is still the same quality software coming from Mozilla. Not to mention that several Firefox &#8220;distributions&#8221; would be a support nightmare.</p>

	<p>As to &#8220;dumbed-down versions of famous extensions&#8221; &#8211; the requirements on features in Firefox are very different from requirements on extensions. As I wrote in the reply to the comment above, even if Adblock Plus ever gets incorporated in Firefox, I don&#8217;t expect its user interface to &#8220;survive&#8221; the process. Extensions are installed by a conscious decision, Firefox features on the other hand come pre-installed and should require an absolute minimum of configuration if any at all &#8211; they have to just work. Phishing protection does it nicely and I don&#8217;t see why anybody would have a problem with it, even the power-users who will likely not need it. Session restore should not nag you either unless you crash (and it is far more reliable than any of the session restore extensions around), so that&#8217;s a nice feature as well.</p>
