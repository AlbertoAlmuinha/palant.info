<p>&#8220;Very “clever”. You should try to read the article, I wrote about this settings that can be changed from the user interface by the way. I also linked to the documentation and said that the option has been added with Internet Explorer 6 SP 2.&#8221; </p>

	<p>Sorry, it wasn&#8217;t really clever because I found it didn&#8217;t work. I just wanted something to automate the process to be able to apply it over several machines instead of having to do it manually. Anyway, sorry again, I do read your articles and find them very interesting and informative.</p>
