	<p>I love firefox and <span class="caps">IMO</span> every website should have to be configured to support both IE and FF, I hate needing to use a website that only supports IE, it is very inferior to FF and has alot of issues such as freezing/locking up and having to be restarted, if not locking up the entire pc forcing user reboot.  These are the top 2 browsers in the world, any web page should be available to both of them.</p>
