title: The hazards of MIME sniffing

<p>Webmasters probably know one particularly &#8220;helpful&#8221; feature of Internet Explorer&nbsp;&mdash; if you happen to misconfigure your web server and it sends <span class="caps">HTML</span> files designated as text files, Internet Explorer will silently correct this mistake and display the files anyway. Of course, if you <strong>wanted</strong> to display <span class="caps">HTML</span> as text (because you want to show the source code, or because it really is a text file with <span class="caps">HTML</span> snippets in it) it still will be displayed as <span class="caps">HTML</span>. And if you, as a user of a non-IE browser, ever came across a misconfigured server that displays <span class="caps">HTML</span>/images/Flash as plain text&nbsp;&mdash; now you know why nobody bothered fixing the mistake. This feature is called &#8220;<span class="caps">MIME</span> sniffing&#8221; and many articles have been written about it, so I don&#8217;t need to repeat them.</p>

	<p>However, there is a less known side of <span class="caps">MIME</span> sniffing. Have a look at <a href="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/9045/xssoj7.png">this image</a>. Doesn&#8217;t look dangerous, right? Now try to open it in Internet Explorer. What happened? As it comes out, <span class="caps">MIME</span> sniffing in Internet Explorer isn&#8217;t limited to text files. If it finds anything resembling <span class="caps">HTML</span> code in images it will interpret the image as an <span class="caps">HTML</span> page. In this case a comment in the image contains a <span class="caps">SCRIPT</span> tag, and Internet Explorer promptly executes the script. This opens an <abbr title="Cross-Site Scripting"><span class="caps">XSS</span></abbr> vulnerability in any site that allows users to upload images (many forums do).</p>

	<p>How can you protect yourself? As a user you can go into security settings for the Internet Zone and switch off the &#8220;Open files based on content, not extension&#8221; option. This option has been <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2brows.mspx">added in IE6 SP2</a>, yet even in Internet Explorer 7 it is still not switched off by default&nbsp;&mdash; so Microsoft is well aware of the problem but security of the users doesn&#8217;t seem to be important enough.</p>

	<p>As to web developers, I know three solutions. The easiest is adding a <code>Content-Disposition: attachment</code> header to the output which will make all browsers download the file instead of opening it (the hole in Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets was fixed in this way). Unfortunately, with Internet Explorer images with this header don&#8217;t work in web pages, so you will need another solution unless you are really only offering files for download. <span class="caps">AMO</span> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=372808">fixed this hole</a> by recoding all uploaded images which strips out any <span class="caps">HTML</span> code they might contain. Finally, you can simply <a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/2004/04/06/getting-around-ies-mime-type-mangling">make sure that the first 256 bytes of the file don&#8217;t look like <span class="caps">HTML</span></a> (can usually be done for text files). Here you can either remove dangerous strings or add something at the beginning just to make IE happy.</p>

	<p>And speaking of Internet Explorer &#8220;features&#8221;, the critical vulnerability in Internet Explorer that <a href="/2007/01/12/speaking-of-ie-security">effectively makes same-origin policy useless</a> still hasn&#8217;t been fixed. That one has been known for a year now and still counting. The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cross-Site-Scripting-Attacks-Exploits/dp/1597491543/sr%3D1-1/qid%3D1170769149?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><span class="caps">XSS</span> Exploits: Cross-Site Scripting Attacks and Defense</a> already calls it &#8220;perhaps one of the most dangerous browser bugs ever found&#8221;.</p>
