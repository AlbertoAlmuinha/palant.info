<p>Glad you found the article interesting.  It&#8217;s slightly misleading, since Firefox <strong>does</strong> come with a basic ad-blocker; it&#8217;s just not as simple or well-designed as Adblock Plus.  It doesn&#8217;t seem like <span class="caps">ABP</span> has a particularly complex interface (as compared with, say, the Firefox &#8220;Privacy&#8221; preferences tab).  Could you go into a bit more detail about what seems too complex?</p>
