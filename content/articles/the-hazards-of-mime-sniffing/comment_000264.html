	<p>A lot of what you said makes sense.</p>

	<p>There is one thing , I wish Firefox would do mime sniffing on.</p>

	<p>That is when it is suppose to download something; check the <br />
extension and see if the extension looks like it could be<br />
a html page. If so then do mime sniffing and display the page if it is a html page.</p>

	<p>I seen too many &#8220;download html pages&#8221;(with a php extension) get downloaded instead of being displayed.</p>

	<p>Remember , we do not live in a perfect world.</p>
