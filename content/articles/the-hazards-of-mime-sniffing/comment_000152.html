	<p>Totally Off-topic as well, but I think the right path would be to make Firefox like a Linux distro, so Mozilla provides only the basic building blocks, and distributes a bundle of selected thrid-party addons that meet quality and usefulness criteria, but which can be replaced by users if they want.</p>

	<p>The current practice of putting dumbed-down versions of famous extensions right into Firefox, and not making them optional is very annoying. Phishing protection, session restore etc case in point</p>
