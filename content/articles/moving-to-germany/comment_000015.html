	<p>He, that&#8217;s funny &#8211; I just went to Darmstadt last weekend,<br />
to attend one of the Firefox 2 release parties, at the<br />
university (playing the role of the oppressed SeaMonkey <br />
minority ;-). Didn&#8217;t see much of the city itself though&#8230;</p>

	<p>Have a good time there!</p>
