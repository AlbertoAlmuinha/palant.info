	<p>I just came back from Germany a few days ago and now (in a few hours) I am going there again. This came quite unexpectedly, I didn&#8217;t know myself until two days ago. This time I will stay in Darmstadt for a few months, working with the guys at the university and hopefully producing something useful together. I should come back to Oslo in the beginning of March to finish my PhD thesis&nbsp;&mdash; plan is to be all done before May. That&#8217;s some crazy time coming up&#8230;</p>
