<p>Obviously, I am not a developer of ryzomcore, so I don&#8217;t know a lot about it. The in-game browser is a single component implemented under code/nel/src/gui/group_html.cpp &#8211; removing it should be trivial. You can search the repository for places where it is being used. It&#8217;s quite a few, none of them seem really critical though.</p>
