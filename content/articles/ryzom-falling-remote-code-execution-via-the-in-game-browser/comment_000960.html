<p>Nothing new. The Lua support was added during R2 days to simplify extending the R2 system. The web browser really only practically could run “action handlers” back then, though, as those were originally merely added in for the Help system tutorial to show some tooltips on the UI. Except, you could also run Lua through action handlers anyway, and with some trickery you could use more action handlers through commands to lead the browser to your custom crafted webpage to run scripts in the game. Lua scripting was then eventually added to the browser anyway. Most of us who were working with NeL back when WG took over Ryzom were very much against their excessive overreliance of the ingame webbrowser for their new “features”, and their toy projects weren&#8217;t a priority for us, so nobody really cared about the <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> support or other fancy webbrowser features. It&#8217;s simply not necessary for any of us to have a full blown webbrowser in the game. Also, the Ryzom game support team generally does not communicate with the open source community, unless we had some shiny new toy. It&#8217;s a mostly different group of developers that just happens to share the same repository.</p>
