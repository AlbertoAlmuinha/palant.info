<p>How much effort is required to remove the in-game browser completely? Or rather, how much of the <strong>ui</strong> uses the web component?</p>

<p>I am working on a side project in my spare moments and I would like to completely remove in-game chat, browser, etc. In my opinion (not that my opinion matters), “ryzomcore” should only contain “core” functionality. I&#8217;d rather strip unnecessary components where I can, and use external applications to simplify the maintenance over-head.</p>
