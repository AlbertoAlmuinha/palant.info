	<p>I agree with the sentiment that developers are introducing vulnerabilities by using the wrong tools. I would also add that they are not actively looking for vulnerabilities themselves. </p>

	<p>Developers should be thinking like attackers and doing their best to break their own software. Further to that, they should be getting their software independently tested by experts, or failing that, at least scanning for vulnerabilities using the very extensive tool set out there. There&#8217;s really no excuse these days.</p>
