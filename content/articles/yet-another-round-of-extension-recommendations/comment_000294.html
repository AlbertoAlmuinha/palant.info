	<p>&#8220;I havenâ€™t seen a single site that would not work with Firefox. &#8216;&#8217; you wrote about IE Tab.</p>

	<p>Maybe you do not spent a lot of time surfing on internet !</p>

	<p>Unfortunately or not IE Tab is a must have .</p>

	<p>You miss lines or information on some sites.<br />
Exemple: http://www.holiday-rentals.co.uk/<br />
the owner login&#8230;if you do not install IE Tab the line about the <span class="caps">VAT</span> does not appear and you can&#8217;t fill the form.<br />
I asked them to correct it 2 years ago still the same.</p>

	<p>www.lefigaro.fr,problem  etc&#8230; </p>

	<p>Even Dell.com I could not complete this order without to install IE tab. (It was 2 years ago I did not check this year)<br />
www.progreso.com.do, I can&#8217;t send you money from this bank if IE Tab is not activated.<br />
Friendly regards<br />
