<p>There are caveats with some of those:</p>

	<p>ChatZilla — If you’re someone like me who’s in like 30 channels 24 hours a day, it will use a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of memory. Using XULRunner (as of sometime last year), like 200 MB after a few weeks or a month. And then it’ll probably crash. While I’m sure it’s Gecko’s fault (and the obvious and useful choices CZ made since it’s based on Gecko, like using <span class="caps">HTML</span> for channel views), that doesn’t make it any more usable on a system without a lot of extra <span class="caps">RAM</span>.</p>

	<p>Live <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Headers — Something to be aware of is that it isn’t always exact. Capitalization of header names can vary (I send “ETag” headers and it shows “Etag”) and if you send more than one of some headers, it will be collapsed into one. Also, the Page Info header tab will list headers in <code>&lt;meta http-equiv&gt;</code> tags at the end (but their names will be all-lowercase). I use <a href="http://web-sniffer.net/" rel="nofollow" >Web-Sniffer.net</a> when I need to see <strong>exactly</strong> what is sent.</p>

	<p>(Lists don’t work in comments? That sucks.)<br />
(Nor does surrounding code in @s?)<br />
(<span class="caps">HTML</span> is also stripped instead of escaped in the Message box after hitting the preview button. Hopefully it won’t be stripped when I submit this.)</p>
