	<p>Besides the more complex extensions, some the &#8220;less powerful&#8221; extensions provide great use. I love Download Statusbar because I simply hate Fx&#8217;s Download Manager or a floating status window that disappears when I go back to Firefox. Having a small progress bar on the status bar is really nice. </p>

	<p>Permit Cookies is a small but really useful extension. I just set my Firefox to &#8216;session&#8217; all cookies as default and then use permit cookies to always allow or totally block a cookie. The control/status icon sits in the status bar and changes color to show the &#8216;allow&#8217; status for each site you are on &#8230; nice.</p>

	<p>Firebug is also a terrific extension. It was a little buggy at first, but I think that the last update really helped with that.</p>
