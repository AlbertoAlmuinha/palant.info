<p>LiveHTTPHeaders only displays the headers as Gecko has them. They might be normalized already (though this is rarely the case). And &#8211; of course a sniffer can get more information, theoretically. But using a sniffer is very rarely necessary if you have LiveHTTPHeaders. And you cannot replay a request with a sniffer (note that this feature also has its limitations but it is very useful nevertheless).</p>
