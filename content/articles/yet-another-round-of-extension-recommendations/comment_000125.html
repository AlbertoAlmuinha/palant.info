	<p>I agree for all unrecommended extensions.<br />
However, I have to disagree for an extension: <strong>Chatzilla</strong>.<br />
Firefox is already known to be &#8220;heavy&#8221;. It&#8217;s a web browser. Adding <span class="caps">IRC</span> possibility has nothing to do with Firefox.</p>

	<p>If you want to use <span class="caps">IRC</span>, you&#8217;d better use an IM software like Miranda IM (for example). I had been using Chatzilla, but I understood the problem when I had to restart firefox (Java site for example ;-) ). I think you like Chatzilla because <span class="caps">IIRC</span> it was kinda pretty, but this extension can&#8217;t be in the recommanded list.</p>

	<p>The extension <strong>Userchrome.js</strong> could be in recommanded extensions too. In fact, it should be built in Firefox. This extension allows to customize browser easily. However, Javascript can be very evil, and can be poorly used, like for an extension&#8230;</p>

	<p>Else, I also think LocationBarÂ² and Download Statusbar indirectly allow a better navigation.</p>
