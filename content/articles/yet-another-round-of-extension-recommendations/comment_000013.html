	<p>Just as Adblock Plus gets used without noticing i recommend &#8220;Drag de Go&#8221;, u can alter the default settings to let u open links in the background just be clicking and dragging a link, instead of right clicking and going to open in new window. It also lets u select text and drag the selected text to open up a search window in the background with ur default search engine.</p>
