	<p>I&#8217;ve tried NoScript intensively and I&#8217;ve got mixed ideas about it. The main flaw in my opinion is the &#8220;trusted/untrusted&#8221; mechanism. White/Black lists are proven to be un-effective and annoying, maybe un-effective because annoying :). Once you have allowed a site to execute scripts you can&#8217;t really know what will happen one day. And &#8220;untrusted&#8221; is the whole <span class="caps">WWW</span> out of your &#8220;trusted&#8221; list, so you are always asked to authorize something until the white list grows out of control. Does it make sense? You need a &#8220;detection by behaviour&#8221; or some euristics to run the scripts in a &#8220;sand box&#8221; and then let them execute or not if they comply the &#8220;rules&#8221;. <span class="caps">IMHO</span>.</p>
