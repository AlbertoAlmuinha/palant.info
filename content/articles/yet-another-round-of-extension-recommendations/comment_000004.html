	<p>I find IE Tab very useful for Web Development.  And while rare, I still come across the odd site where it is faster and easier to switch the tab to IE, do whatever I wanted to do, then switch it back afterwards.  A few days ago Picasaweb wasn&#8217;t loading photos in Fx &#8211; it was fixed the next day, but while it was broken I just switched the tab to IE to use the site.</p>

	<p>The extensions lists weren&#8217;t too bad&#8230;I have 8 of the &#8216;best&#8217; ones installed (out of my 40-odd extensions) and only <span class="caps">ABP</span> out of the &#8216;worst&#8217; lot.  I agree about FiltersetG, Fasterfox and Noscript though, they&#8217;re all awful.</p>
