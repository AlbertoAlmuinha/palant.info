	<p>I use a lot of the same extensions Greg does.  But I recently did away with the Context Search extension after (finally) realizing I could simply drag one or more words to the search bar to effect the same thing.  When you drag to the search bar and use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4096" rel="nofollow" >Second Search</a> extension, it pops up the search menu nicely.  If the Context Search extension had a menu icon, it would be easier for me to pick out among all the other context menu items, and I might use it again. Oh well, who cares, right?</p>

	<p>Oh&#8212;regarding Firekeeper:  I think it&#8217;s useful, if (a big &#8220;if&#8221;, I know) it works without introducing other problems.  And so far, to me it seems to do just that.  I recently began using the <a href="http://www.malware.com.br/" rel="nofollow" >Malware Block List</a> with Firekeeper.  Nice idea that seems to work pretty well.  But the default Firekeeper list seems pretty lacking so far.</p>
