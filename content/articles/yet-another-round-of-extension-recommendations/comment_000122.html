<p>I hadn&#8217;t realized how Adblock Plus worked.  Now I&#8217;m wondering if it would provide better page-loading performance than I now get with Ad Muncher.  (And there&#8217;s also the system-wide performance issue regarding Ad Muncher&#8217;s use of global hooks.)</p>

	<p>I have 37 extensions installed, a few of which I think are very good.  I won&#8217;t bore anyone with any more detail than that!</p>
