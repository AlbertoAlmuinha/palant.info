<p>I like Noscript though. I definitely agree that it is an excellent annoyance blocker, In fact I use it as such.<br />
Noscript is my first line of &#8220;defence&#8221;, I have configured it to allow all top level domains while blocking scripts from all 3rd party sites.<br />
This first line takes care of surprisingly many ads that are outside my whitelist.</p>

	<p>Then I have <span class="caps">ABP</span> for the finer surgery, it easily takes care of the rest, especially with the aid of Element Hiding Helper and the various subscriptions.</p>

	<p>Then I also use CookieSafe/View Cookies CS to block all cookies by default, and manage the 20-30 cookies from sites I view regularly.</p>

	<p>Blacklisting by default in Noscript is annoying as heck since it breaks sites for me far too often and then I have to allow the scripts anyway plus reloading the sites. This is rarely the case with cookies though, so I find the approach of blacklisting by default acceptable in case of cookies.</p>

	<p>Those 3 are like my trinity of web privacy :3</p>

	<p>(And of course <span class="caps">ABP</span> is the most important of my extensions. <span class="caps">ABP</span> is 60% of my reasons to use Firefox if that tells you something)</p>
