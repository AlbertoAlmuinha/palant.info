<p>As I said &#8211; I expect you to disagree. But last time when I tried Miranda I couldn&#8217;t stand the user interface. And I generally didn&#8217;t see any standalone <span class="caps">IRC</span> clients with a good user interface. I also don&#8217;t understand what you mean by &#8220;heavy&#8221;. ChatZilla doesn&#8217;t add any complexity to the browser (one additional menu item). It doesn&#8217;t have any impact on performance or memory use unless you start it &#8211; that&#8217;s what I expect. It doesn&#8217;t seem to cause any significant changes in performance when it is running though is uses up some memory for the backlog &#8211; also exactly what is expected. Restarting Firefox is a problem however, which is why I might go for a standalone ChatZilla running on XULRunner in future (no sooner than Firefox will run on XULRunner of course, otherwise it would be a waste of memory).</p>

	<p>I only listed extensions that I have been using for a while so that I can tell for sure whether they are worth using. I never used Userchrome.js however, and neither did I use LocationBarÂ² or Download Statusbar.</p>
