	<p>I agree that easypass already solved those issues unfortunately the message there is: deterministic = bad and it looks that everyone agrees which doesn&#8217;t look good for easypass popularity. I think there is still one valid point &#8211; plaintext metadata. It&#8217;s not crucial for security but somewhat privacy issue ( especially with online syncing involved). Shouldn&#8217;t it be encrypted same way as legacy passwords? I think there is no benefit for the user having ability to access them without masterpasss. If there is no downside of it please consider it for future verions of easypass.</p>
