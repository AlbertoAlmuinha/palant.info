<p>It&#8217;s the same algorithm, it produces the same results for the same input &#8211; there are unit tests ensuring that. So security isn&#8217;t affected in any way. At the moment, the fallback isn&#8217;t used on Firefox (unless you do something weird that disables native PBKDF2 support which is actually possible). However, seeing how well asmCrypto works I consider using it for everything &#8211; already because having only one code path is simpler and more reliable than a major path and fallbacks.</p>
