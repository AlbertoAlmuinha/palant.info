	<p>Virtually every non-deterministic password manager has sync option of encrypted data available so those issues should have common solutions. I don&#8217;t think decrypting data is necessary. I wonder if extension-side sync is needed at all when users can (or already do) syncing on their own alongside other files with dropbox, owncloud etc.</p>
