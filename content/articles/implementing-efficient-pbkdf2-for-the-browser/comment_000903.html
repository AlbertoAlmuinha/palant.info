	<p>I think you could still print it  after providing masterpass but not before.</p>

	<p>Also is syncing encrypted files different that syncing plaintext files? Those files aren&#8217;t heavy so  it&#8217;s not much for transfer here. I think masterpass isn&#8217;t needed for syncing encrypted or not. I assume that legacy passwords are synced too so you will sync encrypted metadata + encrypted legacy password instead of plaintext metadata + encrypted legacy passwords.</p>

	<p>Personally I wouldn&#8217;t put unencrypted files in any online storage because of potential breach, leak or account steal.</p>
