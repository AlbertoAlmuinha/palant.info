<p>Nope, that&#8217;s about very basic password managers. Easy Passwords saves a state, this addresses the first two issues. It&#8217;s a very simple state however, one that you can print out as a paper backup. This state can also be synced without being concerned about security issues &#8211; it is worthless without knowing the master password (I am currently working on automatic sync functionality). Easy Passwords also uses a combined approach, it can store legacy password &#8211; these will be encrypted with an individual key derived from your master password (that&#8217;s issue #3).</p>

	<p>The last issue is valid of course, you better don&#8217;t lose your master password. How would that happen however? It&#8217;s not like you reuse that password elsewhere. By far most likely scenario <span class="caps">IMHO</span> is a malware infestation on your computer. Problem is, if your computer is compromised then no password manager will save you. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the malware only needs to get your master password or whether it needs to copy your password vault as well. It can easily do either, and it can even collect your passwords as they are being entered on the web &#8211; without even knowing where these are stored.</p>
