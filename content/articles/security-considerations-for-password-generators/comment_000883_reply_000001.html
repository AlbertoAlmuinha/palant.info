<p>There is already the possibility to back up all data, from the &#8220;All Passwords&#8221; page. It&#8217;s not a file format that will be usable without Easy Passwords, which is why I created <a href="https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues/11" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/palant/easypasswords/issues/11</a> &#8211; if the passwords are displayed then you can print the page or save it and encrypt by whatever means you like.</p>
