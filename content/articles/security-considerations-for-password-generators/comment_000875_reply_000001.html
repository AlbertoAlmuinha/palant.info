<p>Yes, I somehow overlooked this one. It&#8217;s not like there is a single category listing all password generators on <span class="caps">AMO</span>. There you go &#8211; added it to the top of the list. The crypto appears to be identical to Password Maker X, meaning: large choice of algorithms, all of them offering pseudo-security. It also allows storing your master password on disk which you shouldn&#8217;t do &#8211; the master password is encrypted and the encryption key is stored right next to it, yet another piece of pseudo-security.</p>

	<p>What&#8217;s exactly the deal with customizability? I only looked at the screenshots but it seems that Eric implemented all the same concepts, merely in a somewhat less convenient way (state of the art was quite a bit different ten years ago when his extension was written). There is plenty of password tweaking options but I don&#8217;t see why anybody would use them. My goal with Easy Passwords was making passwords require as few configuration parameters as possible, while still being compatible with pretty much every website out there. Which exact features are missing?</p>
