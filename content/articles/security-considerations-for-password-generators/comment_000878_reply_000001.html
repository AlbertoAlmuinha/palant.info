<p>I wonder whether &#8220;memorizing even one strong password is beyond abilities&#8221; applies to you or merely somebody you&#8217;ve heard about. If it is the latter then I&#8217;d consider it a rumor. The problem is usually not memorizing a single strong password, it&#8217;s memorizing a strong password you don&#8217;t use regularly &#8211; and with Easy Passwords you <strong>are</strong> using it regularly. No matter how it is implemented, allowing weak master passwords is a security issue that I&#8217;d rather not implement. For now, &#8220;many non-tech savvy users&#8221; aren&#8217;t my problem because these will never install my extension in the first place.</p>

	<p>Filling in usernames is planned, this feature is far from trivial however. The approach for filling in passwords changed already &#8211; if you focus a specific password field only this field will be filled out (should do for password changes). One time option seems pointless to me, maybe you could explain under which circumstances this is needed (adult websites?). Having to type master password twice increases the annoyance factor significantly but doesn&#8217;t really help much (e.g. consider Caps Lock being stuck, an unusual keyboard layout or simply remembering the password incorrectly, both passwords will be identical and still wrong).</p>

	<p>I think you misunderstood the thing about &#8220;two characters&#8221; &#8211; Easy Passwords doesn&#8217;t validate the first two characters of your password, it rather validates the first two characters of a generated password. So chances of you mistyping the master password and Easy Passwords not detecting it are rather small, 1 in 6724 to be precise. The chances of you making the same mistake twice should be considerably higher.</p>
