	<p>Maybe we came from different environments then. For me it&#8217;s not a rumor &#8211; it&#8217;s ubiquitous. As &#8220;non-tech savvy users&#8221; I mean those whose passwords are regularly in top 10000 common passwords leaked &#8211; let&#8217;s say &#8216;Jane1967&#8217; or something. I thought that password hashers would be good solution for them. They don&#8217;t need to be in 1% passwords security elite ~20% is enough. Also some people need it only once a week or less &#8211; far from regular.</p>

	<p>You already allow choosing anything as masterpass even &#8216;aaaaaa&#8217; and it can&#8217;t be different since it&#8217;s up to the user. Allowing password modifier in any case would <span class="caps">IMPROVE</span> security (with weak masterpass and strong).</p>

	<p>You are right that those users I mentioned won&#8217;t install your extension and I wouldn&#8217;t advice them to do it (for now) but is it your goal to develop another excellent password security solution which nobody uses?</p>

	<p>In any case I appreciate your work. Maybe I wanted too much. Good luck!</p>
