	<p>Yeah simplicity is nice goal to have but the reality is that users have different needs = they use something in different ways than others. There is no one solution that fits all.<br />
This is why I prefer versatility|customizability|optionality.</p>

	<p>You said &#8220;There is plenty of password tweaking options but I donâ€™t see why anybody would use them&#8221;. I&#8217;ll add an example:</p>

	<p>As you wrote, security that this extension provides is partially based on strong masterpass provided. But memorizing even one strong password is beyond abilities of <span class="caps">MANY</span> non-tech savvy users! (and retyping it every 10 minutes as memory clears itself).</p>

	<p>What those users needs is to translate weak password i.e. &#8216;dog&#8217; into strong one. I don&#8217;t know if your crypto with weak masterpass is better than weak crypto with strong masterpass but it&#8217;s certainly not secure. This is where &#8220;plenty of password tweaking options&#8221; come in place.</p>

	<p>In passwordmaker there are many ways to &#8220;obfuscate&#8221; provided masterpass (username, modifier,custom character set, prefix,suffix, l33t language level).</p>

	<p>Providing all of those is probably unnecessary but I&#8217;ll vote for add &#8220;custom password modifier&#8221; option which work like this:</p>

	<p>default (as it is now): crypto(&#8216;masterspass&#8217;) =&gt; crypto(&#8216;dog&#8217;)<br />
enchanced: crypto(&#8216;masterpass+modifier&#8217;) =&gt; crypto(&#8216;dog+custom_string&#8217;)</p>

	<p>So in reality user master pass is &#8216;dog+custom_string&#8217; but she has to type only &#8216;dog&#8217;. The modifier has to be saved along password names and site options.</p>

	<p>Of course this solution is less secure if someone has access to your computer (but then she could just install keylogger and it&#8217;s all over) but is way more secure than using &#8216;dog&#8217; as masterpass and dealing with malicious website or stolen databases.</p>

	<p>Other users who don&#8217;t need this option may ignore it (nothing changes to them). This is what versatility|customizability|optionality is about.</p>

	<p>Few other things:</p>

	<p>Ability to fill usernames (automatically or user can choose the appropriate field by himself)<br />
Fill only if field is empty (useful when changing passwords)<br />
One time option (password is generated and filled to current website without storing anything in memory)<br />
Typing masterpass twice to validate (avoiding typos)</p>

	<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>: You wrote &#8220;two characters are sufficient to recognize typos in most cases&#8221;. If I understand this correctly I think that two characters are <span class="caps">NOT</span> sufficient to recognize typos especially when strong masterpass is provided. Therefore &#8220;running it twice&#8221; is better option to validate password.</p>

	<p>Above all thank you for incredible work you do!</p>
