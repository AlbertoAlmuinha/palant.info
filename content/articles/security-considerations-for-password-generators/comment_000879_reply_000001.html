<p>Improving master password security is on the list of issues to be resolved &#8211; while I&#8217;m not going to forbid choosing &#8220;aaaaaa&#8221; as password, there should be a good indicator explaining that this isn&#8217;t good as your password.</p>

	<p>The extension targets experienced users for now &#8211; simply because that&#8217;s the only group where I can hope that they understand the concept and install it. Whether it is even possible to make a compelling argument towards installing a password generator for non-tech savvy users is questionable. But that&#8217;s something I can worry about once the usability issues are out of the way (meaning: security indicators, user names, platform support, sync etc.).</p>
