	<p>Will there be a facility to optionally export a backup of passwords for known sites? (I understand the risk) Perhaps as an encrypted 7z of a key3.db and logins.json so in an emergency it could be quickly recovered without using easy password gen. From my understanding I think that will not be necessary, yet I am scared of losing access for some as yet unknown reason and having to use &#8220;forgot password&#8221; on every website that is not legacy!</p>
