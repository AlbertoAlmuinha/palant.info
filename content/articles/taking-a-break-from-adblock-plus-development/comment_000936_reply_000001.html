<p>You seem to be missing my point. Of course I am aware that the old system had issues and needed to be replaced in one way or another. And I am also aware that Firefox is losing relevance and needs to become more attractive again. As I said, I know why Mozilla rushed this move. That doesn&#8217;t mean that as an extension developer I feel good about it being rushed.</p>

	<p>Sure, multiprocess isn&#8217;t merely hard per se &#8211; it certainly is, but that&#8217;s only part of the problem. A large delaying factor was extension compatibility of course. Mozilla blaming it all on extension developers wasn&#8217;t entirely fair however. From what I could tell, it was largely about arriving on a solution that was easy enough to use. Extension developers didn&#8217;t make the jump initially simply because originally it required so much complexity that it was impractical (Adblock Plus had some multiprocess code around Firefox 4, I know what I am talking about).</p>

	<p>How are Electrolysis and Web Extensions not comparable? Both are extremely complicated changes, and in both cases Mozilla had to make sure that existing extensions (at least those that can be ported in general) can work reasonably well. When multiprocess support became mandatory, users didn&#8217;t notice &#8211; job well done. Web Extensions on the other hand caused issues for a large percentage of users, and the extension developers received the blame. Many of these issues could have been avoided with a longer testing period or merely by delaying out-of-process extensions on Windows (the inconsistency between operating systems here turned out to be a major contributing factor to non-reproducible bugs). Mind you, for extension developers Electrolysis was far less problematic because support could be added gradually to the existing extension. Web Extensions on the other hand required completely replacing the existing codebase all at once &#8211; my suggestions to allow a gradual migration have all been dismissed, most likely due to the tight schedule. So it&#8217;s not  a surprise that many bugs were only discovered after pushing out Adblock Plus 3.0 to the entire user base.</p>
