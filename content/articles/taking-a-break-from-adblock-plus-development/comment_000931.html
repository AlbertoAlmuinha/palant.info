	<p>I&#8217;ll be always grateful to you for creating <span class="caps">ABP</span> back in the days when ad companies started shoving ads down our throats and Firefox+ABP was the only option to get rid of them. Apparently, I started using Firefox because of <span class="caps">ABP</span> and it was the first add-on I used. Things have changed now &#8211; there are many adblockers around (I myself have become a uBlock Origin user). But <span class="caps">ABP</span> was my first savior from irritating ads and trackers and I honestly appreciate your work on it.</p>
