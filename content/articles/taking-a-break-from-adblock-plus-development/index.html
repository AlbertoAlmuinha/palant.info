	<p>After twelve years of working on Adblock Plus, the time seems right for me to take a break. The project&#8217;s dependence on me has been on the decline for quite a while already. Six years ago we <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/introducing-eyeo-gmbh-the-company-behind-adblock-plus">founded eyeo</a>, a company that would put the former hobby project on a more solid foundation. Two years ago <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/changing-roles">Felix Dahlke took over the <span class="caps">CTO</span> role from me</a>. And a little more than a month ago we launched the <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/adblock-plus-browser-add-on-gets-comfy-with-firefox-57">new Adblock Plus 3.0 for Firefox based on the Web Extensions framework</a>. As damaging as this move inevitably was for our extension&#8217;s quality and reputation, it had a positive side effect: our original Adblock Plus for Firefox codebase is now legacy code, not to be worked on. Consequently, my Firefox expertise is barely required any more; this was one of the last areas where replacing me would have been problematic.</p>

	<p>So I am taking all of 2018 off. It&#8217;s not merely about being tired of working on the same project. I also noticed that I&#8217;ve grown irrationally attached to <span class="caps">XUL</span> and Gecko, as I&#8217;ve accumulated lots of knowledge in that area over the years and helped many others learn as well. Consequently, while I see Mozilla&#8217;s motivation for their rushed Web Extensions move, I cannot feel positive about it. This isn&#8217;t a good prerequisite when staying in touch with Mozilla is part of the job description.</p>

	<p>Next year I will only get involved in Adblock Plus if my assistance is absolutely required (in other words: most likely not at all). Instead, I want to get a clear head, and learn new things. My <a href="https://palant.de/2016/04/19/easy-passwords">Easy Passwords extension</a> is a very promising project that definitely needs more of my time, and I would like to contribute to a bunch of open source projects. I also want to spend more time doing security research again, which should help pay the bills as a side effect.</p>

	<p>Theoretically, there is already no reason for people to contact me about Adblock Plus directly. Many still do however, so here is a quick reference:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If a Firefox bug affects Adblock Plus, you should add <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?user_id=602840">this user</a> to Cc on Bugzilla (don&#8217;t send emails there, nobody will receive them).</li>
		<li>If you have an issue with Adblock Plus, <a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/">the forums</a> are the place to ask questions.</li>
		<li>If you want to report an Adblock Plus bug, <a href="https://issues.adblockplus.org/">the issue tracker</a> is the right place (again, ask in the forums if you need assistance).</li>
		<li>If you want to contribute to Adblock Plus development, it&#8217;s easiest to do so <a href="https://github.com/adblockplus/">on GitHub</a> (other tools are used internally but you aren&#8217;t required to use them).</li>
