<p>Although I&#8217;m not using AdBlock at the moment I have used it in the past to block (aal) Flash using a very simple rule :-), I want to thank you for all the work you did and hopefully the new extension <span class="caps">API</span> will get mature very quickly so that it will be a good replacement for the classic add-on <span class="caps">API</span>&#8230;</p>

	<p>As a Firefox user I fully agree that the switch from the classic <span class="caps">XUL</span>/XPCOM <span class="caps">API</span> to the new one has been rushed, I do hope however that in the coming your the managers and developers at Mozilla will do a good job in getting almost all of the features back which were used by <strong>all</strong> classic extensions &#8211; not sure whether this is required at the moment for AdBlock Plus though&#8230;.</p>
