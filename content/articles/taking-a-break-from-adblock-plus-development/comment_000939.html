<p>&gt; When multiprocess support became mandatory, users didn’t notice – job well done.</p>

	<p>I wouldn&#8217;t wish to get into a huge back and forth over this, but I just wanted to point out that the main reason for this is precisely because it never really became &#8220;mandatory&#8221; from the users&#8217; perspective; up until 56, there were still people using addons that forced them into singleprocess mode, and after upgrading to 57 they came into the Firefox <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel(s) asking &#8220;why does Firefox suddenly have five processes instead of one?&#8221;.</p>

	<p>I feel like this is a huge problem with &#8220;gradual rollouts&#8221;, where some users end up getting worse performance/responsiveness in the product than others because they don&#8217;t realize that they are using addons that are disabling or crippling their experience in some way; users aren&#8217;t experts in <span class="caps">XUL</span>/XPCOM or how it works, their intuition seems to be that if they are experiencing a problem in Firefox, that all users are experiencing the same thing. I can&#8217;t count how many times people have come into the <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel asking for help, only to be told &#8220;did you try with addons disabled?&#8221; (which in the mozilla support community has almost become an inside joke like the IT Crowd&#8217;s &#8220;have you tried turning it off and on again?&#8221;), and then of course we find out that it was an addon, and then the user is left embarrassed regarding their former diatribes regarding Mozilla&#8217;s alleged shortcomings.</p>

	<p>In any case, I hope there are no hard feelings in anything I&#8217;ve said. I probably wouldn&#8217;t have even left a comment if not for the response you wrote to the other commenter; it just felt like a weird comparison to me given that WebExt in part is precisely aimed at addressing the delays caused by e10s, I would even go as far as to say e10s delays were likely the straw (or bale of hay) that broke the camel&#8217;s back and resulted in Mozilla saying &#8220;enough is enough&#8221;, so referring to the delays in a positive context seemed awkward to me.</p>

	<p>Happy Holidays, and enjoy your break, you deserve it. =)</p>
