<p>Thanks to the great work that your team and you have done, and your detailed and edifying blog posts, I have helped my network of family and friends browse the web for the last 10-odd years without fear of malware. Additionally, a number of them live in India where bandwidth was not bountiful, so blocking ads saved them $$. </p>

	<p>Enjoy the break, and return recharged. As the creator and maintainer of Elasticfox for 3-years (2008-11), I know that <span class="caps">XUL</span> is both powerful and eccentric. Keeping the extension fresh and useful was tiring for that time, so hats off to you for sticking with it for so long. I am excited to use your &#8220;Easy Passwords&#8221; extension. I had it installed from the day you announced it to about 6-months ago. I had to stop using it because I lost passwords twice. Thankfully, I had a backup.</p>

	<p>Best wishes!</p>
