	<p>Credit heromat: Surely you just forgot to mention that Google allegedly payed 25 million â‚¬ to Eyeo GmbH, the company behind Adblock Plus, in order to participate in the &#8220;acceptable ads&#8221; program, a &#8220;feature&#8221; which is turned on by default and allows users to &#8220;surf more comfortably&#8221;. And that you are (or at least was) one of the directors.<br />
I&#8217;m most certain that there are people out there who would call this business model &#8220;blackmailing&#8221;, but I could also be wrong.</p>
