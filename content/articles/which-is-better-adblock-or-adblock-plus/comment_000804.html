	<p>Thanks Wladimir. Interesting blog. I only recently started using Google Chrome and today noticed AdBlock symbol on my toolbar. I don&#8217;t recall installing it or asking Chrome to activate the extension. So I have taken the step of deactivating all extensions! I will have a look at AdBlock Plus website and decide whether or not I need it, so thank you for this blog and it&#8217;s commentators &#8211; I feel safer already.</p>
