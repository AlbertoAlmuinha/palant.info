<p>It isn&#8217;t really a new product, my understanding is that they were on it since 2011. The main product is actually a freemium (closed source) application for Windows that works outside the browser. They apparently noticed that this approach has issues, so they started offering browser extensions as well. The browser extensions promote the paid application as the &#8220;full version.&#8221; These extensions have been developed independently of Adblock Plus but are clearly heavily expired by Adblock Plus and probably violate the GPLv3 license terms. Some website content has also been copied from adblockplus.org almost verbatim.</p>

	<p>I have no idea how well these extensions work but I guess that you are more interested in trust, right? As I already said, it is completely closed source. The company behind this product is Performix, a Moscow-based consulting company. The project website has a privacy policy that lists explicitly what information the extensions collect. That information seems to be mostly correct, e.g. it mentions that extension installations and updates are being reported to their server unconditionally. It claims however that only extension type and version are being sent there, in reality it also has a unique client ID that is being transmitted. And it sends some user settings along, in particular whether acceptable ads have been enabled.</p>
