	<p>I am using AB+ on my bootcamp partition in Firefox, but sadly had to use Adblock in Safari on the mac side (Firefox&#8217;s accessibility with the Voiceover screen reader  isn&#8217;t there yet.). Now I did my research and realised that there is in fact an AB+ for Safari and have immediately switched. I guess it was either not around when I got the mac first or the other adblock just came up in the results first and I assumed it was the same thing. Your post was quite helpful and it made me realise something&#8230; When I first installed the extension last year in June, it said it was free, but that donations were accepted. Recently I reinstalled my OS from scratch thanks to a botched Yosemite dev preview upgrade, and this time the message I got on first load was different. It said that the extension isn&#8217;t free anymore and I&#8217;m required to donate to the project, saying they wouldn&#8217;t prevent me from using it but were hoping that I would follow the instructions in good faith. <span class="caps">IDK</span> if that was supposed to make me feel pity or what, but after reading this it makes me guess this could be somehow related (IE the offers could be presented to people that don&#8217;t actually give adblock money), not that I received any myself.</p>
