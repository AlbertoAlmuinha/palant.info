<p>I doubt that this was the main problem. Most of the time websites are trying to see whether some ad failed to load and assume that an ad blocker is active &#8211; affects Adblock Plus as well of course. This approach is far from being reliable, it doesn&#8217;t tell you which ad blocker it is and it won&#8217;t give you a user ID that survives clearing cookies.</p>
