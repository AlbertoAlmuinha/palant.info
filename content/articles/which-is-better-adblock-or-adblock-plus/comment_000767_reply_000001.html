<p>We are aware of a few performance issues in Adblock Plus for Safari, but the one you are describing doesn&#8217;t sound like it. You might want to create a topic in our forum (<a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=18" rel="nofollow">https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=18</a>, registering isn&#8217;t required to post) and describe the issue in more detail.</p>
