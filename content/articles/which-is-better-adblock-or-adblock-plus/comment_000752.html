	<p>You should really consider rebranding â€“ the majority of users have been conditioned by the App Stores of the world so that when they see &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;X Plus&#8221;, they expect that &#8220;X Plus&#8221; is the premium/monetized version of &#8220;X&#8221; with a couple of features added in to justify the cost.</p>

	<p>Heck, I&#8217;ve been <strong>using</strong> <span class="caps">ABP</span> for years and until I read this post I always assumed at the back of my mind that AdBlock was a lite version that was made by the same group.</p>

	<p>You seem to have the opposite situation here. It may not be convenient but you might be perceived a lot better if people didn&#8217;t subconsciously think of you that way.</p>
