<p>The AdBlock project has multiple people working full time, it&#8217;s posting job ads promising salaries from $80k upwards. I am pretty certain that their operation is no longer sustainable from donations only, not even close to that. So please take the information you see on the AdBlock website with a grain of salt &#8211; maybe it was correct a year ago, right now it is definitely outdated.</p>
