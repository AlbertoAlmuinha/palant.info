<p>Thank you. My comment there is currently waiting for moderator approval. Here is what I said:</p>

	<p>Gabriel, I respectfully disagree with the points you are making here.</p>

	<p><em>AdBlock is still an open source, GPLv3 project</em></p>

	<p>Yes, technically speaking it is still open source. However, it is no longer an open project which is what I was talking about. By making the repository private and by adding changelog entries that don&#8217;t match the actual changes you are making it harder for other people to verify what you are doing.</p>

	<p>Note that I explicitly wasn&#8217;t criticizing the hidden issue tracker so I don&#8217;t see why you chose to justify that aspect. Even though you&#8217;ve put something better in place for end-user support (we did as well), it is still a good idea for an open source project to leave the issue tracker visible to make the decision processes more transparent. But it certainly isn&#8217;t something you absolutely must have.</p>

	<p><i>In fact, this is an actual line of code from the AdBlock source:<br />
&#8230;<br />
Not exactly subtle!</i></p>

	<p>I wasn&#8217;t really talking about this line of code, rather the one connecting to https://goldenticket.disconnect.me/goldenticket/ticket/fetch which is far less obvious. But let&#8217;s not be picky. So, how many people noticed that line of code and asked you about it? Where did you announce your partnership with Disconnect and did you explain the implications this has for your users?</p>

	<p><em>Besides that, the folks over at Disconnect are all about privacy.</em></p>

	<p>Sure. But privacy is all about trust. When people installed AdBlock, they were asked whether they trusted the AdBlock project. When they accepted, they didn&#8217;t know that Disconnect would be on board as well. As I said, Disconnect has a great privacy policy and maybe they even live by it. But everybody should make their own decisions on who they trust. Again, there would be absolutely no issue at all had you announced your partnership.</p>

	<p><em>User IDs are randomly generated and aren’t retained across different machines, browsers, or reinstallations.</em></p>

	<p>Yes, just like cookies &#8211; and you could have used cookies instead. However, unlike cookies this user ID will survive clearing history and it won&#8217;t care about people using private browsing.</p>

	<p>Do you remember which Chrome feature was criticized the most when Chrome first came out? Right, the unique client ID they assigned to users upon installation, all for the greater good of course. It took a while but Google finally <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Google-Chrome-to-do-away-with-unique-IDs-953601.html">decided to get rid of this magnet for bad press</a>. But at least they documented it from the very start.</p>

	<p><em>All ads are still blocked by default.</em></p>

	<p>Yes. Disconnect search ads will only be whitelisted if the &#8220;private search&#8221; feature is enabled (which seems to be opt-in). Is that something that people are informed about when they opt in?</p>

	<p>And of course the MixPanel tracking isn&#8217;t ads, so I guess whitelisting this by default wasn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>

	<p><em>This is so the AdBlock homepage knows if AdBlock is installed</em></p>

	<p>A user ID isn&#8217;t required for that, a simple &#8220;yes, AdBlock here&#8221; would have been sufficient.</p>

	<p><em>Did you know AdBlock didn’t even have a home page until the middle of last year?</em></p>

	<p>No, I didn&#8217;t. adblockforchrome.com was created in March 2012. Your Google+ page has posts dated 2011. Even this blog has a post from 2011. So if the point was showing that you had no means of communicating with your users &#8211; I don&#8217;t think so. From my point of view, 2013 was merely the point where adblockforchrome.com functionality moved to getadblock.com.</p>

	<p>So, is a privacy policy the only change you are planning to implement?</p>
