<p>Interesting how you say &#8220;allegedly&#8221; and still treat it as a fact. Somebody invents a big number, presents no evidence whatsoever, and you believe it? See also my reply to comment 8.</p>

	<p>Acceptable Ads is something we have always been up front about. We explained the reasons why we do it. We also explained why we do it the way we do it. We went through a number of community discussions with it. Sure, what we&#8217;ve got here isn&#8217;t something that everybody is happy with&nbsp;&mdash; that&#8217;s something we had to accept. In the end, the user is still in control. So even the people who disagree with us can simply uncheck a preference and forget about it. And we do everything to make sure they know how to do it.</p>

	<p>How is that comparable to what AdBlock has been doing?</p>
