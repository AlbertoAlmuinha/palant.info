<p>I&#8217;d rather prefer that Michael Gundlach rebrands his product. We&#8217;ve built up a strong brand with Adblock Plus, it&#8217;s a project that has been evolving for the past eight years. The side-effect is unfortunately that many shady and a few less shady projects are trying to monetize on our brand. If we rebrand now and again invest time and effort into creating a new brand the problem will simply come back once we succeed.</p>
