<p>Sure, Adblock Plus makes money &#8211; we never made a secret out of it, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to sustain the project otherwise. I fully agree that this isn&#8217;t a bad thing as long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt the users and the users know what is going on.</p>

	<p>As to the name and logo &#8211; the AdBlock project chose a name and logo that are confusingly similar to ours. No, I&#8217;m not happy about that either.</p>
