<p>That is indeed an issue, we are aware of it. So far we have been focusing on the format of ads, improving content is something that&#8217;s currently beyond our reach. Of course, we wouldn&#8217;t whitelist anybody who is in the fraudulent advertising business &#8211; but that&#8217;s not the common scenario. Typically, the advertising networks are simply unable to detect all the fraud and phishing due to the volumes they are dealing with. That&#8217;s particularly true about Google, I&#8217;m sure that they are working hard on keeping this kind of ads away from their search engine &#8211; after all, their reputation is at stake here. But it is an extremely hard problem on that scale.</p>

	<p>So if you are worried about fraudulent ads then I can only recommend disabling acceptable ads. Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure what we can do about it. Suggestions are welcome (not as blog comments please, either in our forum or via mail to me).</p>
