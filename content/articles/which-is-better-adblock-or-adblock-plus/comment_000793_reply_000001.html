<p>I actually looked at the source code of your Firefox extension &#8211; I didn&#8217;t really study it thoroughly but some parts looked awfully familiar. Of course, making it open source would be one way to address licensing concerns. :)</p>

	<p>Yes, please link to the source of the text on the page. So far we haven&#8217;t looked into choosing a proper license for adblockplus.org content but we&#8217;ve been very liberal when people asked us about using that content &#8211; but using it without asking and without attribution of any kind isn&#8217;t nice.</p>
