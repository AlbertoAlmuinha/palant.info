<p>Hi Wladimir!</p>

	<p>Thank you for looking into our privacy policy, of course we should mention user ID being sent.</p>

	<p>&gt;&gt; and probably violate the GPLv3 license terms</p>

	<p>I guess we should make our extension open-source so you can look at the source code and do not make such statements. Open source is a good thing so we&#8217;ll do it soon.</p>

	<p>&gt;&gt; Some website content has also been copied from adblockplus.org </p>

	<p>Are you talking about the page with filter rules syntax? Adguard extends <span class="caps">ABP</span> syntax so we&#8217;ve taken some parts of the article from the &#8220;Writing Adblock Plus filters&#8221; article.</p>

	<p>I think it is our mistake that we don&#8217;t mention the source of these parts. Is it ok if we mention <span class="caps">ABP</span> and add the link in the disclaimer?</p>

	<p>&gt;&gt; Interestingly, there seems to be an entire network of companies involved</p>

	<p>We have two projects we are working on. Hosting company and Adguard. That is why there is a number of companies. We need an offshore company to make buying hardware for hosting simpler.</p>

	<p>So we&#8217;ve created Performix <span class="caps">LLC</span> which one and only purpose is developing Adguard. Trademark has been transferred to it.</p>
