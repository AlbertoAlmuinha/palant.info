<p>Replied to his remaining points today (August 4th):</p>

	<p>It seems that a few people will actually read this blog post now (when I replied earlier there were no links to either this blog post or the blog itself), so I should probably address your remaining points as well.</p>

	<p><i>I wouldn’t presume to know his or his team’s mind</i></p>

	<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t know what the AdBlock team was thinking when they implemented some of the &#8220;features&#8221; in question (I wish I could). I&#8217;ve only communicated with Michael Gundlach so far, he seemed to be an able developer and not the sneaky type. Unfortunately, the privacy violations I found in combination with your contradicting promises can only be explained by either malice or incompetence. And assuming that Michael is still involved in the project (seems to be the case), incompetence doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>

	<p><i>We use it to get an anonymous, very rough idea of what our user base looks like.</i></p>

	<p>Right now, the AdBlock website is still claiming that &#8220;AdBlock won&#8217;t save or retrieve &#8230; information for any reason beyond what is required to make it work.&#8221; From your blog post it seems that you don&#8217;t see anything wrong with this. Is retrieving this information (combined with a unique user ID) somehow required to make AdBlock work? Or are you planning to change this statement on the website?</p>

	<p><i>We surveyed a tiny group of users and asked them if they’d like using Disconnect’s functionality in AdBlock and how they’d like it funded. This of course requires adding the code to let the surveyed users try the feature.</i></p>

	<p>Ok, let&#8217;s assume that this set of changes was really just &#8220;a survey&#8221; for you when it was implemented. Let&#8217;s even assume that the entire code could have been simply removed had the users said &#8220;no, don&#8217;t like it&#8221; &#8211; even though so much effort was invested into it. Then it is still strange that you&#8217;ve implemented two sets of survey functionality &#8211; one working through your own server and another that worked through Disconnect&#8217;s (the latter having obvious privacy implications). Ok, let&#8217;s write this off as &#8220;incompetence.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Even with these assumptions, the survey functionality was done with AdBlock 2.6.20. The changes between AdBlock 2.6.21 and AdBlock 2.6.27 only touched Disconnect functionality. So, are you saying that not mentioning Disconnect wasn&#8217;t the main intention when these changes were described as &#8220;beta test for survey&#8221;?</p>

	<p><i>The phrases “monetizing their users” and “they didn’t want anybody to notice” conjure up a mental picture of AdBlock’s users all being secretly turned into dollar signs. In fact, what we’re doing is straight up asking our users where we should take AdBlock next.</i></p>

	<p>Quite frankly, I have no idea how many users saw the message and what exactly it said. This isn&#8217;t part of the source code and you didn&#8217;t bother documenting any of it. The point isn&#8217;t to brag but these things <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/adblock-plus-user-survey-results-part-0">can be done differently</a>.</p>

	<p>What I know is that an unknown number of AdBlock users had Disconnect functionality enabled for them, obviously as a test before that feature is rolled out to the entire AdBlock user base. I also see that you are promoting paid Disconnect memberships and that you are automatically whitelisting Disconnect ads when the user enables the Disconnect feature. The latter happens without any notification, the user isn&#8217;t informed that ads will show and he cannot disable the whitelist either. So you are making sure that your partner earns money, and you do it in a sneaky way that disempowers users. The logical conclusion is that you are either getting your share of that money or that you were promised it once the feature is rolled out to all AdBlock users. If that&#8217;s not the reason then I&#8217;m very interested to hear what it is.</p>
