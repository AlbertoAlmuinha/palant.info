<p>While we do fund our project through the acceptable ads program (otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t even be able to pull it off), we really do it because of the websites struggling to survive &#8211; I&#8217;m not happy with the current situation either but so far nothing other than ads can provide them with a reliable source of income.</p>
