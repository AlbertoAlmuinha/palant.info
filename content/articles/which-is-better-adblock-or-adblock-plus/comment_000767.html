	<p>Wow Crazy!</p>

	<p>I made an effort to use <span class="caps">ABP</span> on all my browsers and devices, but just recently switched back to using Adblock on Safari.  I found that <span class="caps">ABP</span> on safari running on older hardware caused the browser to become unresponsive for up to 5-10 seconds at a time and it was really too much to deal with (2008 Macbook Air).  </p>

	<p>I guess I&#8217;ll be switching back to <span class="caps">ABP</span>, but it bums me out that its not the top performer on safari.</p>
