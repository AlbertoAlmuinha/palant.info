<p>There has been lots of misinformation with regards to acceptable ads, in particular a series of <span class="caps">FUD</span> articles from a particular blogger. Some people are unhappy that we implemented this feature in the first place (which is understandable but I think we made our reasons clear), so they were just too willing to believe any conspiracy spin. This now comes up every time a topic even remotely related to Adblock Plus is discussed.</p>
