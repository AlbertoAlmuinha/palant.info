	<p>Very sad story. I didn&#8217;t realize this. I trusted Adblock for years and it really saddens me that they finally gave in to the same enemy they were fighting against.</p>

	<p>In any case, I was long aware of your acceptable ads program, but was never aware that the participation in it is optional. Your post helped me be much better informed, and, needless to say, I uninstalled Adblock forever and will only be using your addon from here on.</p>

	<p>Evidently we all must do a better job at researching what exactly are we using.</p>

	<p>Thank you very much for your effort on this informational campaign, and please keep sharing your insights whenever. =)</p>
