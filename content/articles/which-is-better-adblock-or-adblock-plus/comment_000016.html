	<p>It&#8217;s important to note that after downloading Adblock, you are redirected to a page that asks for donations, where the creator mentions that he now does Adblock full-time and relies on users to help out. This leads the user to believe that his primary source of income is the user donations, which is why monetization with Disconnect.me is such a big issue.</p>
