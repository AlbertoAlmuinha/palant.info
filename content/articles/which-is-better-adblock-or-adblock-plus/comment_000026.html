	<p>I used to use adblock plus and when the &#8220;acceptable ads&#8221; came, I thought you guys sold out and switched to adblock. </p>

	<p>I now realize you were being transparent and gave an option to disable that. I just switched back to adblock plus. But based on what I am reading, I am wondering whether the &#8220;do-not-track&#8221; functionality you have added is capable of replacing Disconnect &#8211; since I had that extension as well (and I am now skeptical of that as well). I had already lost faith in Ghostery and switched to Disconnect.</p>
