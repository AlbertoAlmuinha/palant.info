<p>Does that news coverage look like we were hiding anything? This is an aspect of the acceptable ads that has been properly documented: <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads-agreements#payment" rel="nofollow">https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads-agreements#payment</a>. We confirmed it whenever we were asked about it (except in the starting phase when there were indeed no companies paying for it). In fact, the acceptable ads program is a massive effort on our end and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue it without having somebody pay for it.</p>

	<p>But you&#8217;ve got it backwards. Everybody on our list was added because their ads conform to our acceptable ads criteria&nbsp;&mdash; not because they paid us. And it is still user&#8217;s choice whether he wants to support websites or not. The acceptable ads program is explained on every webpage where you can download Adblock Plus from, it&#8217;s mentioned on the first-run page, we had a number of announcements and community discussions about it. What exactly did we hide?</p>
