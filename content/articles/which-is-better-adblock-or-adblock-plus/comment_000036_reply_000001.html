<p>Feel free to make a stronger point in this bug. <span class="caps">AMO</span>s policy is that extensions are allowed to do questionable things as long as these features are opt-in and the user is correctly informed about the implications. This policy makes sense, otherwise the policy would be too limiting and indeed prevent many professional developers from even considering that market &#8211; and <span class="caps">AMO</span> would stay a sandbox for amateurs creating buggy and badly designed extensions. From the description, the extension you are complaining about does things correctly. The user stays in control of the experience and at least the extension description explains things well. Is the description incorrect?</p>
