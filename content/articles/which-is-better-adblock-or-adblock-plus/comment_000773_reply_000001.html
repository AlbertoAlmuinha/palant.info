<p>Adblock Plus no longer has Do-Not-Track support, see <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/removing-do-not-track-support-from-adblock-plus" rel="nofollow">https://adblockplus.org/blog/removing-do-not-track-support-from-adblock-plus</a>. By now this feature is built into both Chrome and Firefox. It does <strong>not</strong> guarantee you that you won&#8217;t be tracked &#8211; it is merely asking the websites to refrain from tracking you. Unfortunately, not too many websites care so far.</p>

	<p>If I understand correctly what Disconnect does, it is rather comparable to the EasyPrivacy filter list that is available for Adblock Plus. You can add it on the first-run page in Adblock Plus (&#8220;Disable Tracking&#8221; feature) or on <a href="https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/#easyprivacy" rel="nofollow">https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/#easyprivacy</a>.</p>
