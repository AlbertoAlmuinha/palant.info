<p>Oh, I remembered that I looked into who is behind AdGuard a while ago &#8211; there isn&#8217;t much information available on Performix <span class="caps">LLC</span>. Interestingly, there seems to be an entire network of companies involved. For example, there is InSoft <span class="caps">LLC</span> (a web hosting company apparently) which owns the AdGuard trademark and has the same <span class="caps">CEO</span>. The same guy is also the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Management Networks <span class="caps">LLC</span>, a company that was founded by some <span class="caps">TLC</span> Center <span class="caps">LTD</span>. I couldn&#8217;t find any registration record for <span class="caps">TLC</span> Center <span class="caps">LTD</span> but it appears to be selling AdGuard licenses and doing nothing beyond that.</p>

	<p>There is also the advertising company AD Shows <span class="caps">LLC</span> which is owned to 70% by the Performix <span class="caps">CEO</span>. The only activity of this company on the web appears to be signing some AdGuard builds.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know what all of this means, your guess is as good as mine. But I strongly suspect that some money laundering scheme is involved.</p>
