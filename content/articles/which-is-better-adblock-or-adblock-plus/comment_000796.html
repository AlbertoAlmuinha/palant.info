	<p>Until this day I thought AdBlock and AdBlock Plus (never heard of the third one, also called AdBlock something) were the same product, just different versions (but by the same developer). It is more than confusing that all ad blocking software products use the same base name and even the same icon in the toolbar (the stop sign).</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t think that monetizing a service is in any way a bad thing, as long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt the users and I&#8217;m sure that AdBlock Plus is making (a lot of) money from various sources as well.</p>
