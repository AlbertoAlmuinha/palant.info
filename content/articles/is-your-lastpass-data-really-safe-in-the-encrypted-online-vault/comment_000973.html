<p>Hi,<br />
Reading your posts, it really seems like LastPass has a huge problem. I&#8217;ve been wondering whether this is a general problem with cloud-base password managers, so I&#8217;ve been looking into a password manager called Myki which basically has the passwords saved on your phone and sends them to your laptop on demand when approved on the phone. Quite interesting, what do you think about it?</p>
