<p>It corrected them to some degree. But these issues run deep, the system just wasn&#8217;t built to protect your data against a compromised server. The whole thing with local encryption is more of a PR stunt, not really a main design goal.</p>

<p>In fact, I discovered another issue allowing LastPass to decrypt your data easily, e.g. if authorities ask for it. Submitted end of November 2018, the issue has been assigned low priority. I&#8217;ll write about it once it is fixed, but I don&#8217;t expect that to happen soon.</p>

<p>While I looked into a bunch of password managers, it&#8217;s by far not all of them. From the ones I&#8217;ve seen, only 1Password had a convincing security approach, they seem to understand the threat models and design their product accordingly. Mind you, I didn&#8217;t do an in-depth review, so there might still be security issues hidden there. Of course, personally I prefer using PfP: Pain-free Passwords but this one I wrote myself and it&#8217;s probably not everybody&#8217;s thing.</p>
