<p>Hi, very interesting, I have a question about the derived encryption key, They mention that the master password (indeed the derived key) does not leave the client computer, is this a contractual deal or is there a technical gate which prevents this behaviour. Client side encryption is really a good feature but if the key remains in lastpass domain and js context, how can we be sure that the key  is not sent to LastPass ?</p>
