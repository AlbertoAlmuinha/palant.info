<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s impossible to say. Cloud-based password managers aren&#8217;t such a bad idea, it is absolutely possible to get them secure. On the other hand, while having your passwords stored locally (or on a phone, doesn&#8217;t make a big difference) is theoretically the more secure option, features added for convenience often punch holes into these solutions. In the end, it all boils down to whether the people building the product are serious about security and know what they are doing. So I am quite confident about 1Password despite it being a cloud-based solution. I&#8217;m also fairly confident about my own PfP extension. Other password managers that I looked at usually weren&#8217;t totally bad but had their weak spots. For example, Keepass is a stand-alone Windows application and provides a small attack surface. Yet it used a weak key derivation until recently and still supports it for backwards compatibility. Also, there is a number of browser extensions providing some comfort and their security level varies a lot.</p>
