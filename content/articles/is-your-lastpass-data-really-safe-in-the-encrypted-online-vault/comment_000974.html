<p>I use Myki as my daily driver. The product is great and the support team is amazing. Apparently the founding team were lastpass users and developed Myki to address the issues associated with cloud storage and master passwords. I give it a 9/10 (not 10 because i&#8217;m still waiting for them to add support for multiple smartphones at the same time. Today you can have as many computers paired to your smartphone as you like but there is a limitation on the number of smartphones. The team assured me that they are working on the feature and will release it this summer).</p>
