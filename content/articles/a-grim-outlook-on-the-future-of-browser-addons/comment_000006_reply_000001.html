<p>Yes, I was probably wrong when I said that this was purely a technical decision. The reason why I formulated it like this was: the union of the APIs used by these top 9 add-ons is already massive. For example, there is one ad blocker on the list, and I happen to know that ad blockers are very demanding. So maybe the implementation isn't mature yet, maybe it isn't quite complete, but it is definitely good enough for a large portion of the existing add-ons (yes, I checked with mine). Add to this a complete lack of documentation/progress tracking on what APIs work and what don't. I mean, with that documentation it should have been fairly easy for AMO to check compatibility on their end, they've done it before. But coming from outside, my impression is that this hasn't even considered.</p>
<p>Personally, I sincerely hope that I got it all wrong and proper add-on support will be restored in Firefox on Android really soon. But seeing this mess sadly doesn't instill confidence. Add-ons are a messy affair, no doubt about that. So now that the rollout is complete, we have a status quo where any voices in favor of extending add-on support will have to fight other metrics.</p>
