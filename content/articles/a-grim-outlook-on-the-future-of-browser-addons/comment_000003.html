<p>I think that the Fenix team have been instructed to get more users at all costs. My guess is that Mozilla has decided that the current tiny and reducing 'market' share doesn't justify the expense of maintaining it. And I think they've decided that incremental change, and copying Chrome, won't achieve that: they have to build something new and different. They;re probably right about that.</p>
<p>Addon users are collateral damage. It's been obvious for months that the team is only interested in 'popular' addons, ones with thousands of users. They've said that more addons will be allowed in the future - but there's no commitment and no timescale. And they don't sound sincere - nobody seems to believe them.</p>
<p>They've now, belatedly, said they'll allow sideloading in nightly:
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/14034
The wording of that - "In the near-term we want to..." doesn't make it sound important and imminent.</p>
<p>Call me cynical, but I think it's a way of shifting the discussion off github to here:
https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/add-on-support-in-new-firefox-for-android/53488/9</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong, that they're actually working on this, and it will go into beta at least.</p>
