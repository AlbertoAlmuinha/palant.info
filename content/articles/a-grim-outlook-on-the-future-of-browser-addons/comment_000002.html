<p>The real reason for the addons problem was that when developers submit an addon they can choose which platform it runs on, OR check the 'all' box. Because firefox crowed cross compatability the developers always ticked 'all' despite android FF having no toolbar for launching these addons. The developers were assuming FF would check, FF assumed the developers would check. Consequently about 2/3 of all the android addons never worked. I reported this solution years ago but like google, mozilla sees the tablet market dominated by ipads and thus didn't give a shit. Poor peoples access to functionality, and thus adoption, has never been a developer concern. So their one killer app - extensions, which first made them dominate the desktop market and later could have let them dominate the android market was never implemented. All because of 1 check box</p>
