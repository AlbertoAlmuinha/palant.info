<p>I'm not close enough to it to be confident, but from what I've heard you're off base with the gatekeeping argument. My understanding is that this is not at all a policy decision, but purely a technical one: specifically, the way Fenix is set up makes custom work required for each WebExtension API. You don't inherit everything that Gecko supports anymore. So to get the top 9 addons working, then looked at the union of APIs needed by those 9 and implemented those, with the intention of adding more in the future. I definitely can't speak to how realistic those future intentions are, though I'm guessing it's too early to judge yet because I imagine the team is still busy with the results of the wide-scale rollout right now.</p>
<p>I wish I could point to a source for the architectural limitation I'm talking about here, but I don't remember where I heard it.</p>
<p>I can't speak to your other complaints. Personally, I see addons as the main competitive advantage of Firefox on mobile, so I would have trouble understanding a product decision that didn't include them. But I don't get paid to make product decisions; maybe there's a reason for that? ;-) I could imagine future drivers, eg integration with desktop content and identity, but that feels further out and addons are the ones that are closest to hand.</p>
