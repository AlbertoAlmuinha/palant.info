<p>If my post sounds like I am criticizing Bugcrowd, that&#8217;s not really the intention. The main issue is indeed companies who decide to run a bug bounty program without having a healthy security culture. While that will do to get the obvious issues fixed, it won&#8217;t necessarily make the overall product more secure.</p>

	<p>As to Bugcrowd staff handling submissions, I don&#8217;t really have enough information to judge their competence. My first issue here was that I didn&#8217;t recognize them as Bugcrowd employees. Sure, they have &#8220;_bugcrowd&#8221; suffix in their names, but that didn&#8217;t make me realize that they weren&#8217;t employed by the product vendor. So I was stunned when they only seemed to be familiar with the impact of web server vulnerabilities and not browser extension vulnerabilities for example. Also, it was too obvious that they didn&#8217;t have product developers to talk to when something was unclear. So the burden of explaining the impact of &#8220;unusual&#8221; issues lies on me here, and with the level of detail expected it&#8217;s not worth doing for issues that will likely be (mis-)prioritized as P4.</p>

	<p>Mind you, it took Mozilla lots of time to make their bug bounty program run smoothly. While they would always involve developers early on and judge the impact of an issue properly without my help, there were other issues. For example, the steps required to get a bug bounty for a submitted report used to be not quite straightforward, and the delays could be significant. And reports affecting web services would be assigned to the wrong group by default, so that the relevant people couldn&#8217;t see them.</p>
