	<p>Hi Wladimir, thanks for the feedback on Bugcrowd. We&#8217;ve been sharing this blog post internally and discussing it :)</p>

	<p>On your first point of some companies not investigating deeper security issues, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bug bounty thing. I think that&#8217;s a <span class="caps">SDLC</span>/internal security culture thing. A bug bounty will only exist inside of the current security culture and practices at a company, it doesn&#8217;t automatically create an internal system that perpetuates behavior. If a company isn&#8217;t properly investing in their <span class="caps">SDLC</span>, proper training of developers, or their security team isn&#8217;t resourced or empowered enough to address systemic issues, a bug bounty won&#8217;t necessarily be able to change that situation. It&#8217;s important that all companies work hard to create a healthy and functioning internal <span class="caps">SDLC</span> and vuln patching/handling process.</p>

	<p>Our internal security team that validates/triages bugs (Application Security Engineers, or <span class="caps">ASE</span>&#8217;s) are folks that have quite a bit of pentesting and security experience. What they&#8217;re asking you for is information that they can use to help explain to the customer, and for them to explain to others in their organization, the impact of the bug. Your <span class="caps">POC</span>s and write-ups help hasten the process of rewarding your bug, prioritizing it internally, and ultimately getting it fixed. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily or always the case that we don&#8217;t understand the bug (though that happens!), it&#8217;s more so that we want to make sure that everyone along the chain understands the impact of your finding.</p>

	<p>Counter to what you think, your write-ups and <span class="caps">POC</span>s can often be shared with the customer&#8217;s development team. Bugcrowd integrates with a team&#8217;s <span class="caps">JIRA</span>, Slack, etc &#8211; which makes it so your submissions can be distributed through their internal processes and systems. Or, of course, those folks can just login to Bugcrowd to see that information.</p>

	<p>I realize that the managed bug bounty is a little bit of a different experience than what you&#8217;re used to with Mozilla or Google, but I&#8217;m hopeful that you&#8217;ll find it to be of your liking eventually. Without this management service, most companies wouldn&#8217;t have a bug bounty to begin with, or their self-managed bounty would provide a less than stellar experience for all involved. That&#8217;s why Bugcrowd primarily only provides managed bounties to our customers.</p>

	<p>Thanks for your time &#8211; always open to hear feedback and enjoy the discussion!</p>
