	<p>I already have loads of preferences userchrome to get Firefox 3 working more like V2 and even V1 did :(</p>

	<p>Firefox touts itself as being heavily customisable, but the devs keep changing things and not leaving any clean way of going back to the old system.</p>

	<p>I can understand doing that when it makes technical sense, but some consideration should be given to people&#8217;s existing workflows. Look how unpopular Office 2007 is &#8211; all the same features are there, they just buggered up the interface. Firefox is starting to look more and more like MS Office &#8211; pretty much feature complete so people start messing with the interface and upset all the current users.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s even worse when it&#8217;s a feature that has a noticeable performance hit, like the thumbnails. It also seems like the devs don&#8217;t stress test the new systems enough. For example, the new history system gets very slow with the default setting of 90 days retention, even on a quad core with 6GB <span class="caps">RAM</span>.</p>

	<p>Why not just have a simple preference option for this? Getting lots of support requests is just a sign of the support website not being easy enough to use. The old code is presumably stable and working, and a full test suite should cover it&#8217;s use. I&#8217;m sure plenty of devs will use the old system anyway, so anything that breaks it will be spotted quickly.</p>

	<p>While I&#8217;m here, why do downloads default to not asking where to save them? I get a lot of people asking me where Firefox puts downloads, especially on Vista where the downloads directory isn&#8217;t even visible by default (i.e. not in Documents, on the desktop or even in Computer, you have to click on your user name to see it.)</p>
