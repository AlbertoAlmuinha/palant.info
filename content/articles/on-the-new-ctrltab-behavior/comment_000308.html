<p>I have to say, that I like the new order of tabs. It&#8217;s like a linked list (with &#8220;tabs&#8221; in the data fields). When switching a tab, it goes through the list from the beginning. When you select the tab you wanted, it is being moved to the front of the list. (Window switching in Windows works the same, I think.) That&#8217;s a logical and somehow natural behaviour.<br />
I find this very useful, if you write a formal email for example: one tab the webmail, the other a dictionary and the other tabs that you have visited before, or that you have not visited yet.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">BUT</span>: The graphical interface slows down the switching process. I know, we&#8217;re not talking about seconds, but I noticed, if you scurry over the keyboard and have released the keys again already, you watch Firefox still rendering the thumbnail graphics. That&#8217;s quite annoying and it needs <span class="caps">CPU</span> resources what leads my laptop to increase the fan speed (and therefore becomes louder). That&#8217;s annoying, if you want to work quietly.<br />
I think, Mozilla should &#8220;outsource&#8221; that again, as it tends towards bloat (or at least something which is not really necessary) (as &#8220;Get Add-ons&#8221; does, too).<br />
I claim for regular users of Firefox, this feature doesn&#8217;t improve usabilty at all and for novice users, it isn&#8217;t accessible enough (most inexperienced users don&#8217;t know of keyboard shortcuts).</p>

	<p>There are more important things to improve than a graphical tab switching interface! The behaviour of switching to tabs when closing one and navigation with the mouse is horrible&#8230; <a href="http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron_news.php" rel="nofollow">Iron</a> (defused Chrome) does it almost perfect.</p>

	<p>I think, you, Wladimir, have some influence on the development, don&#8217;t you? I would be willing to study tab switching preferences in an algorithmic accuracy, so that it can be reused.</p>

	<p>Gruss, Adi :-)</p>
