	<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;new&#8221; Ctrl-Tab behaviour for years â€“ configuring Tab Mix Plus to do so.  I couldn&#8217;t imagine having to live without it.</p>

	<p>If you just want to move to a tab in a fixed, known position, and you have under 10 tabs open, you might want to consider using Ctrl-1 through Ctrl-9: much faster than pressing Ctrl-(Shift-)Tab a number of times.</p>
