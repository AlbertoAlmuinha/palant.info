title: On the new Ctrl+Tab behavior
---

<p>While I usually spend most of my time with stable browser versions, I still use Minefield frequently. And Minefield builds now have the new Ctrl+Tab behavior again. While this feature will certainly help most users navigate around their tabs, I cannot help myself disliking it. And now I finally understand my problem: usually I don&#8217;t even look at the screen when switching tabs.</p>

	<p>When I am switching tabs, most of the time I know already which tab I want to switch to and simply press Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab the required number of times automatically. The new behavior is extremely irritating then as it is impossible to predict what you need to press to get to the required tab. Now I have to visually check the thumbnail to verify that I am switching to the right tab (I know what the tab header looks like but linking it to the thumbnail still requires a conscious decision). It doesn&#8217;t help of course that in the current version it isn&#8217;t very obvious which thumbnail is selected  right now and this selection is indistinguishable from the thumbnail your mouse happens to hover over right now.</p>

	<p>Of course, it is very hard to satisfy everybody when designing a feature like this and some people will always have to relearn. What are my options? Setting &#8220;browser.ctrlTab.recentlyUsedLimit&#8221; to 0 seems to be one, the thumbnails are still distracting then but that&#8217;s something you can get used to. Using Ctrl+PgDn is another option but none of the other tabbed applications I use frequently (Notepad++ and Total Commander) support this hotkey. Still, I wonder whether this feature can be adjusted in such a way that it isn&#8217;t as destructive to my workflow.</p>
