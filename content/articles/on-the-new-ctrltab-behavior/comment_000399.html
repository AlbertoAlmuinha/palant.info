	<p>I&#8217;m using a version of Firefox that has your preferred Ctrl+Tab behaviour (the &#8220;old&#8221; one &#8211; switch to next/[shift]prev. tab in bar), due to compatiblity problems (* see footnote for trivia).</p>

	<p>You claim that the &#8220;new&#8221; way (switch to most/[shift]least recently used tab) is unpredictable and that it forces you to look at the tabs.  However, I find that it is in fact the &#8220;old&#8221; behaviour that forces me to look very carefully at the tab bar &#8211; and then use the mouse or Ctrl+&lt;number&gt; to execute the switch, as Ctrl+Tab is effectively useless for alternating between tabs that aren&#8217;t adjacent &#8211; for example, how would one switch between tabs 11 and 18 with  Ctrl+Tab without carefully calculating the number of (shift+)ctrl+tab presses required, or closely watching the process of stepping  towards the desired tab and letting go of the keys when reaching the destination?  One could manually reorder the tabs (to make them adjacent), but that would require a new way of doing things that&#8217;s not generally portable to other tabbed applications.  Even if you do reorder the tabs, a Ctrl+Tab that always moves one step in a fixed direction still won&#8217;t work to alternate between a pair of tabs, such as for example, a tab with an editing session (like a textbox, such as this one) and a tab with reference data (such as a dictionary), but you have to keep track of whether or not to hold down Shift on next switch, lest you find yourself transferred back in time all the way to tab number 1.</p>

	<p>(I think I might take a look at that tabmix extension&#8230;)</p>

(*) The footnote as promised:<br />
Firefox3 only runs on the latest bloatware versions of Wind0ze.  Really any version of W. that can&#8217;t be configured to wait until you type &#8220;win&#8221; at the prompt is without justification for existence, because you would have switched entirely to Unix (Linux/*BSD, etc.) long ago if it were not for backwards/DOS compatibility.</p>
