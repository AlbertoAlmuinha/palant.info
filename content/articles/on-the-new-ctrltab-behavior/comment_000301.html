	<p>I totally agree with you. This behaviour isn&#8217;t the best solution for people that are used to <span class="caps">CTRL</span>-Tab because we don&#8217;t look at the page content first, but at the position in the tab bar. We memorize how we have organized them. I&#8217;m not sure this behaviour help &#8216;non-expert&#8217; people : each time I see one using a computer, they prefer using the mouse, partly because they don&#8217;t discover the ctrl-tab. For them it seems too technical compared to the polyvalency of the mouse.<br />
Also, if this feature help most of the people, maybe we can show the thumbnails and highlight the tab in the tab bar : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=356162</p>
