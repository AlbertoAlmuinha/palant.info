<p>Since Haploid solved my <a href="/2009/02/10/analyzing-huge-piles-of-code">previous puzzle</a> way too fast, here is another one: what is <a href="">that page</a> really trying to load? And why is it that NoScript and Adblock Plus disagree so much on that&nbsp;&mdash; none of the dozen domains NoScript is showing show up in Adblock Plus and the one request showing up in Adblock Plus doesn&#8217;t show in NoScript.</p>
