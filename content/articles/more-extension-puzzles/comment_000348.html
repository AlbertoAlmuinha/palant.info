<p>I have a question: what happens inside Firefox, when this page is loaded?</p>

	<p>Is Firefox ignoring the ba* things because it doesn&#8217;t know what a type=&#8220;not/a/script&#8221; is? Will it load/request those items (if they would be real adresses/scripts)?</p>

	<p>Will Firefox execute the &#8220;view-source&#8221; script? Or is the script only requested, without any further action?</p>

	<p>Thanks!</p>
