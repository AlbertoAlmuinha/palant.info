	<p>@Aerik, @Wladimir:<br />
In facts the previous issue was the only one who deserved immediate attention, for obvious reasons (a 20 seconds hang is not a vulnerability, but it&#8217;s surely annoying). And just to clarify Wladimir&#8217;s previous answer to Dave, <strong>NoScript blocks the <em>view-source:</em> script anyway</strong>, even if it&#8217;s not displayed in the UI.</p>

	<p>P.S.: AdBlock Plus is not infallible at reporting every script source either, but it also doesn&#8217;t block the ones it cannot show.</p>
