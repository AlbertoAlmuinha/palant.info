	<p>On-topic: Wladimir, I&#8217;d be interested in reading more about your trip to Russia.  I&#8217;ve never been and would like to visit.</p>

	<p>Off: NoScript seems the better tool.  It allows you to automatically accept JS from the visited site and block third party JS &#8211; which usually contains ads and junk.  YesScript is all or nothing.</p>

	<p>Also, it is very easy to stop the &#8220;attention-grabbing&#8221; with NS.  Turn off notifications and temporarily allow top-level domains by default.</p>

	<p>P.S. Thanks for <span class="caps">ABP</span> &#8211; it makes the web a better place. :)</p>
