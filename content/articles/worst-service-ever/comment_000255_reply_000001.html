<p>Is that a suspicion or a fact? I have yet to hear about somebody infected with viruses because he didn&#8217;t use NoScript. NoScript is extremely annoying, built with attention-grabbing UI on purpose and getting in the way of regular web surfing (also on purpose). As such, it is totally unsuited for regular users. So it doesn&#8217;t surprise me when I hear from Firefox developers: &#8220;Integrating NoScript? No, thanks. Maybe something like YesScript&#8221;.</p>
