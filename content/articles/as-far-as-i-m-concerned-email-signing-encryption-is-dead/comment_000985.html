<p>I have to agree. A fair number of people I dealt with used signing in the past, usually via gnupg&#8230; some still do, but I think most have given up. And I only know one friend who&#8217;d routinely encrypt email to other friends&#8230;</p>

<p>And yeah, the rise of cloud-based interfaces like GMail have made it a lot harder to use&#8230; no native clients to integrate with signing/encryption tools, or if there is a native client, it won&#8217;t support that kind of functionality. Plus, encryption tends not to co-exist very well with the ability to search your email history, and like most people, being able to use my email is more of a concern than the prospect of someone being able to read it (since I avoid sending anything sensitive that way).</p>
