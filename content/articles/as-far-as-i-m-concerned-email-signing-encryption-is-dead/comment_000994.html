<p>Yes, I agree that there is little chance of email encryption to gain any meaningful momentum. If at all it would ironically come from B2B, where email is still a key communication means. But it is overall unlikely exactly due to the bad implementation and complexity.<br />
And that has always been the bane of email encryption <span class="caps">IMHO</span>. Technically there is no problem, since Whatsapp is encrypting nowadays and has shown us how to do things so that they get easily adopted &#8211; I mean even when WhatsApp was technically crap in the beginning, they just did everything right when it came to ease of use.</p>

<p>Practical usability is the most important factor. Security comes second. This has never been understood by the guys who developed <span class="caps">PGP</span>, Gnupg and S-Mime. Super-safe and not useable is useless. And becomes obsolete later.</p>
