<p>I agree that for personal use, S/MIME and PGP is overly complicated and really un-necessary. But for B2B it still has lots of use and is continuing to grow (especially digital signatures). You should check out GlobalCerts solution. It is gateway-level, and all user certificates are managed centrally by admins. It is a gateway-level signature/encryption solution, which necessitates a certain amount of trust within your email infrastructure and mail clients/devices, but eliminates all the problems of signing/encrypting direct from each mail client. </p>
<p>Also, we have spearheaded the idea of using DNS to distribute/publish S/MIME public keys of users. Optimally this would be done onto the public DNS via SMIMEA records, but for now we use a proprietary closed system called SecureTier. This allows all our customers to communicate securely via S/MIME with all other customers with no need to exchange a signed email first.</p>
