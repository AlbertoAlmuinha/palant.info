<p>That's actually part of the issue. We looked into deploying email encryption company-wide, so that at least internal communication would be encrypted by default. And we found no feasible way to achieve that. The only possibility would be a mail gateway like yours. That would be pointless for any communication within the company, not being real end-to-end encryption. And maybe I have been communicating with the wrong companies but I didn't see a single signed email come in - so other companies don't have a signing/encryption setup, and the likelihood of a mail gateway on our end doing something useful would be close to zero.</p>
