<p>Great article. By the way, "resistFingerprinting" in Firefox also works by spoofing screen size and browser features and is active by default in well known "hardened" user.js configs like arkenfox (formerly knows as ghacks). What do you think about it, does it also make fingerprinting easier? Thanks.</p>
