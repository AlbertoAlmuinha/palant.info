<p>if my browser is returning a random fake value everytime my browser starts (like "return 1661x3351 this time and return 1920x1080 next time" but for canvas fingerprinting and others), would it makes me more identifiable (easier to trace) across every visit (I know that makes my browser stand out)?</p>
