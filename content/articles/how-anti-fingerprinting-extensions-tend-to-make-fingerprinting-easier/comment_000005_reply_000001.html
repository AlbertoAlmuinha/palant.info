<p>No. While I haven’t looked into the implementation, it most certainly is proper. It rather has its own issues, often causing subtle and unintended website breakage. I’ve seen a bunch of bug reports that developers could trace back to resistFingerprinting, with much effort. The user typically has no chance to figure this out by themselves, and there also isn’t any mitigation other than disabling the setting globally. This might be fine for some users, but it certainly isn’t for everybody.</p>
