<p>What got me into using Canvas Defender (both Chrome and Firefox) was its ability to rotate random values on a timer. So I set mine to about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Now, I have absolutely no clue if it takes as much care to make retrieval of original values difficult, as you have shown here, but at least there is that auto-randomization of values on a set time period to fall back on, even though it doesnâ€™t come configured as such out of the box.</p>
