<p>exportFunction is available for extensions on Firefox (not in Chrome - one of my points why CanvasBlocker is not available for Chrome).</p>
<p>Yes - Canvas Defender is not a good extension and not active (last update in 2017).</p>
<p>If you find anything in CanvasBlocker or have questions about it - feel free to open a discussion or issue at github.</p>
