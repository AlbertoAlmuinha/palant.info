<p>Wow! What a great article! Thanks a lot for the share! So can you recommend some good extension which can be used for anti-fingerprinting and which considers those points you've mentioned in this article? I'm using one at the moment (won't name it in order not to advertise) but not sure if it will "pass your test" :)</p>
