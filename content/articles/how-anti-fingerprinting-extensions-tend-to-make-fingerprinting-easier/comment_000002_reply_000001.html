<p>I don’t know about your habits, but my browser tends to stay open for a long time. So even with this rotation scheme, a random value here is problematic. Change the value more often and these changes might make you identifiable on their own (there is still your IP address which usually only changes daily). Using random values seems logical but it just isn’t the right way…</p>
