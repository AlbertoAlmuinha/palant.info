	<p>I will be traveling a lot, starting this Saturday. I am taking the remaining week of my vacation visiting Cologne and Hamburg, then I&#8217;ll be attending to ACM Multimedia in Santa Barbara, CA and NetGames in Singapore. I won&#8217;t be back in Oslo until November so don&#8217;t expect me to do much Adblock Plus development until then. I&#8217;ll try to answer mails from time to time.</p>
