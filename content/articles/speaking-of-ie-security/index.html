<p>I <a href="/2007/01/05/firefox-security-the-real-picture">recently</a> linked to an <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/01/internet_explorer_unsafe_for_2.html">article</a> stating that users of Internet Explorer have been exposed to known critical vulnerabilities for 284 days last year. That sounds bad enough but unfortunately it is not all. For example I came across a <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/19738/">vulnerability in Internet Explorer</a> that has been ranked &#8220;Less critical&#8221; for reasons I don&#8217;t understand. What this does&nbsp;&mdash; it basically eliminates same-origin checks, any web site can read contents of another site. I put up <a href="">an example</a> that can check whether you are logged in on Google or Yahoo and read out your user name&nbsp;&mdash; provided that you use Internet Explorer. It could just as well read out your mail or change your mail password. It could also go into your banking account if you happen to be logged in. Information on this vulnerability has been published April last year and still unpatched in both Internet Explorer 6.0 and 7.0.</p>
