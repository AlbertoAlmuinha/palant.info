<p>I wondered how long it would take until somebody brings up that argument. Fact is &#8211; I don&#8217;t care where the buggy code lives. Internet Explorer exposes users to this vulnerability so Internet Explorer is to blame. At the very least its developers made sure that the <span class="caps">MHTML</span> protocol can be triggered from XMLHttpRequest, and I doubt many external protocols can be.</p>

	<p>But even if we accept this argument, Outlook Express isn&#8217;t exactly a third-party component. It is developed by the same company, it is distributed through the same channels (meaning amongst other things that it cannot be really uninstalled), it is supposed to be developed in parallel with Internet Explorer. Given all this I cannot understand why I still don&#8217;t see an Outlook Express update that would fix the issue. Is the communication inside Microsoft that bad? I doubt it.</p>
