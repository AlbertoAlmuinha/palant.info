	<p>Chromebug does not use Firebug&#8217;s suspend/resume. jsd needs to be on during startup to gather information on the components as they are compiled. After that suspend/resume could be used. I&#8217;ve not tried to do this since I imagined most uses of Chromebug will be for debugging not running the browser.</p>
