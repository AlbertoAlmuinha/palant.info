	<p>I came across a Venkman &#8220;feature&#8221; that was so unexpected that I even <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478406">filed a JavaScript engine bug</a> on it. Only after Gijs Kruitbosch asked me to test with a clean profile I realized that the JavaScript performance issue I was seeing wasn&#8217;t inherent to Firefox but rather something the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/216">Venkman extension</a> was responsible for. That&#8217;s right, Venkman is degrading JavaScript performance just by being installed, even if you don&#8217;t use it. I had Venkman installed &#8220;just in case&#8221; and this was a big surprise to me.</p>

	<p>The technical details: any JavaScript debugger for Firefox (be it Venkman, Firebug or my JavaScript Deobfuscator) uses the debugging interface of the JavaScript engine, it merely serves as a user interface for it. Usually the debugging interface is turned off and only switched on when necessary. The reason for this: when the debugging interface is switched on it makes the JavaScript engine do some bookkeeping which has an impact on performance (about 15% on the SunSpider benchmark according to my measurement).</p>

	<p>The problem is: Venkman turns on the debugging interface on browser startup so that it is active throughout the entire browser session. And that&#8217;s independent of whether you are actually using the debugger. The only way to turn off this behavior is typing the following command on the Venkman command line:</p>

<pre><code>/startup-init off
</code></pre>

	<p>This will only work until you install a new extension or upgrade Firefox, after that the setting will be reset.</p>

	<p>Why is Venkman doing something like this? The problem is apparently that Venkman cannot &#8220;see&#8221; scripts that were compiled while the debugging interface was inactive. So if you turn off start-up initialization Venkman will always start with an empty file list. You will need to reload the pages you want to debug to see something. Even with start-up initialization some <span class="caps">XPCOM</span> components will remain invisible. This is being caused by <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480765">bug 480765</a> &#8211; I hope that the patch there lands soon and Venkman is adjusted as well then.</p>
