	<p>Firebug 1.4 has an auto-suspend which we use to reduce the overhead of the &#8216;jsd&#8217; layer underlying both Venkman and Firebug. Currently we are &#8216;pause/unpause&#8217; jsd but I think we could turn it &#8216;on&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217;. I don&#8217;t actually know how performance varies with these settings; Firebug layers more work on top of what jsd &amp; venkman already do so we had to implement suspend for our own code.</p>
