	<p>In case somebody noticed that I&#8217;ve been pretty quiet recently&nbsp;&mdash; many things happened which kept me occupied. In particular, I started a new job yesterday and will now be developing <a href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a>. I have been following Songbird&#8217;s development since the very beginning and even managed to develop <a href="http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addons/5">one of the first third-party add-ons for it</a>. It is a very interesting project and a great development team so I am really excited about this.</p>
