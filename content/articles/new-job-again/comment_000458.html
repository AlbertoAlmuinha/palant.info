	<p>Congratulations, and welcome to the Ex-TomTom Club!<br />
I&#8217;m sure you will be as popular with the Songbird team as you were with our team at TomTom.<br />
Remember to concentrate on providing important features like &#8220;less bloat&#8221; and &#8220;faster startup&#8221; and &#8220;more stability&#8221;, which directly effect the user experience, and don&#8217;t worry so much about the formatting of the comments.</p>

	<p>-Don</p>
