<p>Interesting post! I had no idea this level of detail was collected and although I knew Telemetry was opt-out, it would be nice to explain to users (even of beta/aurora/nightly builds) exactly what is collected. Or maybe it&#8217;s just been so long since I&#8217;ve created a profile&#8230;</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m really responding to re-iterate your &#8220;Side-note&#8221;: I find this extremely frustrating and would really like to find a way to stop this. I&#8217;m unsure of the root cause: is it lazy people? Information Mozilla feels they &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; release? New employees not understanding that anonymous people want to be able to read Bugzilla and find context in work that&#8217;s occurring?</p>
