	<p>Thanks for speaking out on this!</p>

	<p>1) I wasn&#8217;t aware of the ClientID in my telemetry, and firmly believed the collected data was aggregate from the beginning, not just in the final public Telemetry Dashboard. I now know that Mozilla has more data on me than I previously thought. I still trust Mozilla, but this came as a slight shock.</p>

	<p>2) This resonates with another privacy concern I have with Mozilla, namely the Firefox Account. I feel that Mozilla&#8217;s narrative changed from &#8220;Never entrust anyone with your data, why would you do this?&#8221; to &#8220;Well, you can entrust us with a little data because we&#8217;re the good guys!&#8221;. I can see the huge benefits of Accounts for the future: easily syncing tabs, bookmarks and history across all my devices, taking Firefox from browser to &#8220;universal user agent&#8221;, but this was nonetheless a culture change that sounded awkward and was heralded with some dishonesty.</p>
