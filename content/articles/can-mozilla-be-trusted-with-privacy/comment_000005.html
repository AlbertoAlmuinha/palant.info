	<p>Thank you for your response, Wladimir. There are two points I&#8217;d like to respond to:</p>

	<p>1) Telemetry does not collect the user&#8217;s IP address. We don&#8217;t report it in the Telemetry packet and we don&#8217;t store it on the Telemetry server side.<br />
2) The &#8220;time since last report&#8221; alternative you suggested would not allow for the same kinds of analyses. For example, it wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell us if a performance issue happens at random or if it affects only a subset of users who share some unusual hardware/OS configuration.</p>
