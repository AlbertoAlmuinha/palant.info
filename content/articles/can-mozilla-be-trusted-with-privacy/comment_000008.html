	<p>@Vladan: I&#8217;m with Wladimir here. There&#8217;s a difference between what Mozilla <strong>does</strong> and what Mozilla <strong>can do</strong> with any given piece of data. You&#8217;re arguing that Mozilla doesn&#8217;t do evil, therefore it can be trusted. Wladimir is arguing that Mozilla can potentially be doing evil, therefore it should not be trusted.</p>

	<p>Imagine for example an <span class="caps">NSA</span> spy infiltrated Mozilla and had root access to all of the datacenters &#8211; what could this malicious actor do with all this data? Certainly he could start logging IP addresses of incoming telemetry pings and correlate them with this clientID. And that means the user has to extend their trust not only to Mozilla&#8217;s software (easy enough to build yourself), but to the integrity of their corporate network as well (impossible to verify). It is this extension in trust that is objectionable.</p>
