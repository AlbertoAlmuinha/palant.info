	<p>I still trust the <em>people</em> currently at Mozilla, but I can no longer blindly assume their policies are written such that I can trust it by default.  Was trying to move to new sync a while back, and reading their policy realized that they have nothing written down about not being able to read your synced passwords.  Currently they can&#8217;t do so because of an implementation detail, but not due to any sort of policy :(</p>
