	<p>Going to cherry pick a statement that wasn&#8217;t necessarily the main thesis because I hear it a lot and disagree:</p>

	<p>&#8220;&#8230;Mozilla is using Google Analytics and Optimizely (trusted third parties?) on most of their web properties. I cannot really find a good argument why Mozilla couldn’t process this data in-house, insufficient resources certainly isn’t it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>We have contracts with Google and Optimizely that outline how we expect them to use the data they get access to via our use of them. The Google one in particular has a special exception that the data we send them can&#8217;t be used by any other accounts except ours (normally, there&#8217;s some sort&#8217;ve magic around data across all of GA being sort&#8217;ve shared, maybe for ads or something, that we considered a hard blocker for our use of GA). Not only is it cost-effective for us to use GA over running our own solution (like Piwik or something), but it gives us some leverage to make Google Analytics better for everyone (we were able to get Google to add an opt-out for certain data sharing that they didn&#8217;t have previously, and made it available to all GA users).</p>

	<p>Improving user privacy on the internet is an important part of our mission, but as with most things, we need to find a balance between extremes to forward the mission. In this case, the people responsible decided that we could do more total good by relying on these services than we could spending resources to process the data in-house. Personally I&#8217;m not convinced that not using GA would actually improve user privacy on the internet at all. People would still use GA everywhere and we&#8217;d just be spending resources to make ourselves feel good about how pure we are. At least this way we can convince Google to change the service in a positive way, and we can also use the resource saved by relying on them to forward the mission in other ways.</p>
