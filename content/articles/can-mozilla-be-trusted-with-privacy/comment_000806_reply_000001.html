<p>Mozilla isn&#8217;t just some corporation &#8211; if it were I wouldn&#8217;t ask that question. Despite some issues, it is still an open project with people that are passionate about Mozilla&#8217;s goals (money helps fund the project but it isn&#8217;t one of these goals). These people spent a month discussing this issue at length, I linked to the discussion. I&#8217;m just surprised that apparently nothing better came out of it.</p>
