	<p>Regarding your side-note, I have also found that annoying a few times when looking at a bug consisting only of &#8220;implement x&#8221; and then reviews without any reasoning or links to more context as to why x is needed or why x has the property of y in the implementation. I&#8217;m surprised I haven&#8217;t seen it brought up on newsgroups yet.</p>
