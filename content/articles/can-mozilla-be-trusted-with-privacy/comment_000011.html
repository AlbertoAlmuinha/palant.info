	<p>I think Mozilla as an organisation has good intentions and really believes in their privacy commitments, this is what I&#8217;ve seen from them consistently over the years and I don&#8217;t think much, if anything, has changed in this regard.</p>

	<p>What I do have concerns about is their operational competency to maintain the same standards going forward, especially as they&#8217;ve got larger in recent years, especially with the more rapid release schedule, and especially as more cloud features emerge. </p>

	<p>When all Firefox did in terms of phoning home was update itself, my add-ons and update the &#8220;bad websites&#8221; list, it was obviously credible to say that your privacy is being respected and protected. Now there&#8217;s telemetry (&#8220;how I use the browser&#8221;), the health report, open tabs and bookmark synchronisation &#8211; a lot more is going on, and a lot more is being stored &#8211; somewhere, for who knows how long and with what identifying information. This is all great for functionality, but to pretend there is no risk would be crazy.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s easy to have a policy about not being evil, and another thing entirely to ensure that all parts of the organisation are not only on board with that policy, but actually carrying it out and protecting the data they&#8217;re charged with.</p>

	<p>Personally, I chose to opt-out of all of these features apart from reporting crash data.</p>
