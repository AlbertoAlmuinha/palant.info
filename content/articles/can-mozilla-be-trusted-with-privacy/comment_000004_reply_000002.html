<p>Forgot replying to one of your points: I am aware that Telemetry is opt-in for stable releases, yet <span class="caps">FHR</span> isn&#8217;t. And my understanding is that <span class="caps">FHR</span> is using the same <span class="caps">UUID</span>. While I certainly have lots of different profiles on my computer as well, there is still one profile that I use for my main browsing and which is online most of the time (typical setup I assume) &#8211; that&#8217;s the profile I&#8217;m concerned about.</p>

	<p>Note that I didn&#8217;t really blame Roberto for anything. It is pretty obvious that he wasn&#8217;t involved in the development of the feature. It was merely my starting point looking for somebody who actually cared.</p>
