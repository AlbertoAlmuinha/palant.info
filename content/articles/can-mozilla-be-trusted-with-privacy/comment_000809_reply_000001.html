<p>Vladan, thank you for the detailed answer. It seems however that I didn&#8217;t bring my point across.</p>

	<p>I didn&#8217;t even look at the data being sent there &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter. What matters is a unique identifier associated with my browser profile and regularly being sent to Mozilla. The IP addresses of these requests are enough to get a complete movement profile for my laptop (a scenario Ben Bucksch already brought up in the discussion from 2012). And while you might argue that this profile identifier cannot be associated with me as a person &#8211; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true. If you have enough data samples belonging to the same user, there are always ways to tell who that user is &#8211; and be it because I logged in on <span class="caps">AMO</span> from the same IP address. So now it&#8217;s Google, <span class="caps">NSA</span> and Mozilla who can track me.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t trust Mozilla, I still assume that people working there wouldn&#8217;t allow anything like that (assuming that the servers are never compromised) &#8211; but I&#8217;d very much prefer that Mozilla wouldn&#8217;t even put itself into a position to do that. Having been on the other side of this discussion, I know that there usually is another way &#8211; it&#8217;s merely harder to come up with. E.g. removing bias can also be done via a &#8220;time since last report&#8221; field (I think the crash reporter actually does it this way).</p>
