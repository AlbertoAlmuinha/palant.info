	<p>I understand your concern, Wladimir. Thanks for voicing it, because I believe that this deserves a discussion.</p>

	<p>Mozilla is now sitting on more data than it used to. We have a number of internal processes and policies to make sure that the data itself infringe on user privacy (e.g. the privacy review mechanism), but you are right that, if a high-profile third-party (e.g. a government agency, or something nastier) manages to get their hands on the data and cross-reference it with other sources, there is a risk of privacy leak.</p>

	<p>This data is critical to Mozilla – without this data, we have considerable difficulties finding out / reproducing problems that impact our users before they become critical. Therefore, I suspect that we are going to proceed with our current policies, or variants thereof.</p>

	<p>However, there is a reason for which Telemetry requires opt-in (on Firefox Release) or allows opt-out (on Beta, Aurora, Nighty), it&#8217;s because we want people to be able to say « no » to this risk. So, if anyone feels that you do not want to share this data with Mozilla, by all means, please go ahead and opt-out/don&#8217;t opt-in. Also, if anyone has ideas on how we can further clarify the risk or decrease it, please share these ideas. You will be helping us improve Firefox / Mozilla.</p>

	<p>By the way, Wladimir, you remark that <span class="caps">FHR</span> doesn&#8217;t follow Telemetry&#8217;s preferences/policies. If my memory serves, we expect to fix this (among many <span class="caps">FHR</span> improvements) by Firefox 39.</p>
