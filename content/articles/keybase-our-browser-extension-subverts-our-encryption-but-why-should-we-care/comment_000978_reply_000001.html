<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the actual app is bad, merely that I don&#8217;t know anything about it and won&#8217;t waste time on it given the circumstances. However, unless I&#8217;m terribly mistaken that security audit isn&#8217;t public so we don&#8217;t know how thorough it was and what kind of issues have been brought up. In addition, if their prioritization process for issues brought up by the external audit was the same as here then it isn&#8217;t worth anything.</p>
