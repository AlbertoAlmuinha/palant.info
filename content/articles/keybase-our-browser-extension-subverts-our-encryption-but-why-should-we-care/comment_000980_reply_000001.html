<p>I don&#8217;t think that Mozilla wants to blocklist every extension that fails to separate its UI from webpages, there are way too many of those. If Mozilla considered that issue important, they would have prioritized an <span class="caps">API</span> that allowed extensions to avoid mixing trusted and untrusted content.</p>
