<p>Actually, Window.openDialog wraps the arguments in nsIVariant, that&#8217;s where I got it from. It looks like the Gecko 1.8 version of that code used nsISupportsPrimitive however &#8211; so maybe my code will only work with Gecko 1.9 regardless of whether you use nsIArray or nsISupportsArray.</p>
