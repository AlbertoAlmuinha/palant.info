This is useful when copying links but it also helps privacy by preventing the search engines from recording your clicks."}

	<p>Google and Yandex search pages have the annoying habit of changing the result link when you click it. So if you right-click the link in order to copy it you get some gibberish instead of what you wanted. This extension disables that behavior &#8211; on any Google or Yandex domain, without having to configure anything. Simply install and enjoy! As an added bonus, the search engine can no longer track your clicks.</p>

	<h4>Known limitations</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>This extension cannot recover links after they have been modified. This This means that it doesnâ€™t work on Google Search on smartphones (tablet version will work fine) or if JavaScript is disabled&nbsp;&mdash; Google will produce modified links from the start rather than changing them when you click the link.</li>
	</ul>
